# MixerAI 2.0 - UI and Authentication Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard UI Update
- Removed the Analytics tab from the root dashboard page
- Simplified the tab interface to only include the Overview tab
- Changed the TabsList grid from grid-cols-2 to grid-cols-1

### 2. User Authentication Integration
- Updated the users API route to connect directly to Supabase authentication data
- Added integration with Supabase Auth Admin API to fetch real user data
- Merged authentication user data with profile information from the profiles table
- Enhanced the user data structure to include:
  - User metadata from Supabase Auth
  - Last sign-in timestamp
  - Role information from user_brand_permissions
  - Fallback avatar generation for users without profile images

## Implementation Details

### API Route Update
The `/api/users` route now:
1. Fetches all users from Supabase Auth Admin API
2. Retrieves associated profile data from the profiles table
3. Merges the data to provide complete user information
4. Determines the highest role for each user based on permissions

### User Data Structure
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  full_name: string,
  email: string,
  avatar_url: string,
  role: string,
  created_at: string,
  last_sign_in_at: string,
  brand_permissions: Array<{
    id: string,
    brand_id: string,
    role: 'admin' | 'editor' | 'viewer'
  }>
}
```

## Benefits
- Live authentication data is now visible in the Users interface
- Simplified dashboard UI focuses on the most important content
- More complete user information for better user management
- Consistent user experience between local and production environments

## Requirements
- Requires SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to be set in environment variables
- Needs the auth.admin.listUsers permission for the service role
