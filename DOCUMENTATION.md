# MixerAI 2.0 - UI and Authentication Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard UI Update
- Removed the Analytics tab from the root dashboard page
- Simplified the tab interface to only include the Overview tab
- Changed the TabsList grid from grid-cols-2 to grid-cols-1

### 2. User Authentication Integration
- Updated the users API route to connect directly to Supabase authentication data
- Added integration with Supabase Auth Admin API to fetch real user data
- Merged authentication user data with profile information from the profiles table
- Enhanced the user data structure to include:
  - User metadata from Supabase Auth
  - Last sign-in timestamp
  - Role information from user_brand_permissions
  - Fallback avatar generation for users without profile images

### 3. Enhanced Todo Example
- Added feature-rich Todo component at `/todo-app` (moved from `/examples/todo-example`)
- Implemented persistent storage using localStorage
- Added due dates with calendar selection
- Added priority levels for tasks
- Implemented sorting and filtering functionality
- Created comprehensive documentation at `/docs/TODO_APP_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Added redirects to maintain backward compatibility

## Implementation Details

### API Route Update
The `/api/users` route now:
1. Fetches all users from Supabase Auth Admin API
2. Retrieves associated profile data from the profiles table
3. Merges the data to provide complete user information
4. Determines the highest role for each user based on permissions

### User Data Structure
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  full_name: string,
  email: string,
  avatar_url: string,
  role: string,
  created_at: string,
  last_sign_in_at: string,
  brand_permissions: Array<{
    id: string,
    brand_id: string,
    role: 'admin' | 'editor' | 'viewer'
  }>
}
```

### Todo Component Features
- Task management (add, complete, delete)
- Priority levels (low, medium, high)
- Due date calendar integration
- LocalStorage persistence
- Auto-sorting by completion, priority, and due date
- Responsive design for all devices

### Routing Structure Issues Fix
- Fixed route conflicts between the `/dashboard/*` routes and the `/(dashboard)/*` route group
- Moved the Todo example out of nested layouts to prevent layout duplication
- Implemented proper redirects to maintain backward compatibility 

## Benefits
- Live authentication data is now visible in the Users interface
- Simplified dashboard UI focuses on the most important content
- More complete user information for better user management
- Consistent user experience between local and production environments
- Example Todo component showcases application features and UI components
- Fixed routing structure prevents duplicate layouts and navigation elements

## Requirements
- Requires SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to be set in environment variables
- Needs the auth.admin.listUsers permission for the service role
- Todo example requires the date-fns package for date formatting
