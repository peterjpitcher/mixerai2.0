For comprehensive details on the Azure OpenAI setup, core principles (including the strict "No Fallback Generation" policy), client configuration, error handling, brand context integration, specific AI tool functionalities, prompt strategies, and testing/debugging methods, please refer to the dedicated [Azure OpenAI Integration](./docs/azure_openai_integration.md) documentation.

### Technical Tools

MixerAI 2.0 includes several technical tools to enhance content creation workflows, primarily powered by Azure OpenAI:

-   **Metadata Generator**: Generates SEO-optimised meta titles and descriptions from webpage URLs.
-   **Alt Text Generator**: Creates accessible alt text for images.
-   **Content Trans-Creator**: Trans-creates content across languages and cultures.

Details on their AI integration and specific functionalities can be found in the [Azure OpenAI Integration](./docs/azure_openai_integration.md) document.

## Brand Management Features

MixerAI 2.0 provides robust features for managing brands, including UI enhancements for brand creation/editing, AI-driven brand identity generation (utilizing URL analysis, regional adaptation, and multi-language support), management of content vetting agencies, and brand-specific visual elements like colors and icons.

- Create and edit brands with basic information
- Generate comprehensive brand identity using AI from website URLs
- Country-specific content vetting agencies suggestions
- Tabbed interface separating basic details from AI-generated content

## Content Vetting Agencies

Content vetting agencies are displayed as a selectable list of checkboxes under the "Suggested Agencies for [Country]" section. When a brand identity is generated via AI, the system will suggest 10 relevant vetting agencies specific to the brand's country, industry, and content needs. These agencies are dynamically generated by the AI based on its analysis of the brand's website content and the selected country.

Users can select from these AI-generated suggested agencies to comply with relevant content regulations. The selected agencies are stored as a comma-separated list in the `content_vetting_agencies` field in the database.

## Brand Color Generation

The system now uses AI to analyze a brand's website and automatically generate an appropriate color that reflects the brand's visual identity. This color is:

- Generated when creating a new brand or regenerating brand identity information
- Stored as a HEX color code in the `brand_color` field in the database
- Used visually in the UI to identify the brand
- Editable via a color picker by the user if they wish to change it
- Customized specifically for each brand based on AI analysis of their website colors and design elements

The brand color enhances visual recognition and consistency throughout the application, making it easier for users to quickly identify and work with different brands.

## User Interface Components

### Brand Visualization Components

#### BrandIcon Component

A consistent way to display brand avatars throughout the application using the brand's color:

```typescript
// src/components/brand-icon.tsx
export function BrandIcon({ 
  name, 
  color = "#3498db", 
  size = "md", 
  className 
}: BrandIconProps) {
  // Implementation details
}
```

- **Features**:
  - Displays the first letter of the brand name in a circular avatar
  - Uses the brand's color for text and background (with opacity)
  - Supports different sizes (sm, md, lg)
  - Fully customizable through className prop
  - Falls back to default blue (#3498db) if no color is provided

- **Usage Examples**:
  - Brand cards in dashboard and brand listing
  - Brand selection dropdowns
  - Content listing where brand is displayed
  - Anywhere a brand needs visual identification

This component enhances visual recognition and consistency throughout the application, making it easier for users to quickly identify and work with different brands.

### User Invitation Page - Brand Assignment Update

The user invitation page (`/dashboard/users/invite`) has been updated to improve flexibility in assigning new users to brands.

- **Previous Behaviour**: Users could be assigned to a single brand via a dropdown menu during the invitation process.
- **New Behaviour**: The brand assignment UI has been changed from a single-select dropdown to a list of checkboxes. This allows administrators to assign a new user to multiple brands simultaneously when sending an invitation.
- **Technical Changes**:
    - The frontend state management in `src/app/dashboard/users/invite/page.tsx` was updated to handle an array of `brand_ids` instead of a single `brand_id`.
    - The UI now renders checkboxes for each available brand.
    - The API endpoint `/api/users/invite` will need to be (or has been) updated to accept an array of `brand_ids` in the request payload to support this multi-brand assignment.

This change streamlines the onboarding process for users who need access to several brands from the outset.

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

- Implementing retry logic for transient Azure OpenAI API errors
- Adding more detailed validation for environment variables at startup
- Enhancing the AI-generated content with additional examples and references 

## Workflow User Assignment

The MixerAI 2.0 application now supports assigning users to workflow stages during the workflow creation and editing process.

### Key Features

- **User Assignment by Email**: Users can be assigned to workflow stages by email addresses
- **Existing Users Recognition**: If an email belongs to an existing user, they are automatically assigned
- **User Invitation**: If an email doesn't match an existing user, an invitation is created
- **Role-Based Access**: Each workflow stage has an associated role (editor, admin, etc.)
- **Multiple Assignees**: Each workflow stage can have multiple assignees

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema

The workflow schema uses a JSONB column to store steps with assignees:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Draft Review",
      "description": "Initial review by the content author",
      "role": "editor",
      "approvalRequired": true,
      "assignees": [
        {"email": "user1@example.com", "id": "user-uuid-if-exists"},
        {"email": "user2@example.com", "id": "user-uuid-if-exists"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

A separate `workflow_invitations` table tracks invitations for users not yet in the system:

```sql
CREATE TABLE workflow_invitations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  workflow_id UUID REFERENCES workflows(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  step_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL,
  invite_token TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending', -- 'pending', 'accepted', 'declined'
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(workflow_id, step_id, email)
);
```

#### User Interface

The workflow creation and editing pages include:

- Input field for entering assignee emails
- List of current assignees with removal option
- Email validation to ensure correct format
- Prevention of duplicate email assignments

#### API Implementation

The API handles:
1. Checking if an assignee email belongs to an existing user
2. Creating invitations for new users
3. Tracking assignee status in the workflow steps
4. Managing invitation lifecycle (pending, accepted, declined)

### Usage

1. Create or edit a workflow
2. Add steps as needed
3. For each step, enter email addresses to assign users
4. Save the workflow
5. Users will either:
   - See their assignments directly (if already in the system)
   - Receive an invitation email (if not yet a user)

### Future Enhancements

- Email notification system integration
- User invitation acceptance flow
- Assignment history tracking
- Reassignment capabilities

- **Responsive Design**: Layout adjustments for different screen sizes

### Usage

1. Create or edit a workflow
2. Use the step reordering buttons to arrange workflow steps in the desired sequence
3. Select the appropriate role for each step using the descriptive checkbox cards
4. Toggle "Optional step" for steps that can be skipped in certain cases
5. Use the "Auto-generate" button to quickly create professional step descriptions
6. Add assignees by email to each step in the workflow
7. Remove assignees with a single click if needed

The enhanced workflow management provides a more intuitive, user-friendly interface that makes creating and managing complex content workflows simpler and more efficient.

## Workflow API `user_role` Enum Fix (YYYY-MM-DD)

An error was identified in the `POST /api/workflows` endpoint when creating new workflows with step assignees.

### Problem
- The API endpoint was attempting to use the role "brand" when creating workflow invitations for step assignees.
- The `user_role` enum in the database is defined as `('admin', 'editor', 'viewer')` and does not include "brand".
- This mismatch caused a PostgreSQL error: `invalid input value for enum user_role: "brand"` when the `create_workflow_and_log_invitations` RPC function was called.

### Solution Implemented
- Modified `src/app/api/workflows/route.ts` in the `POST` handler.
- The logic for populating `invitationItems` for the RPC call was updated.
- The `role` assigned to an invitation item is now explicitly checked against the valid enum values (`'admin'`, `'editor'`, `'viewer'`).
  ```typescript
  // In src/app/api/workflows/route.ts, inside the POST handler:
  invitationItems.push({
    // ... other properties
    role: ['admin', 'editor', 'viewer'].includes(step.role) ? step.role : 'editor',
    // ... other properties
  });
  ```
- If `step.role` (coming from the frontend request) is one of the valid roles, it is used. Otherwise, it defaults to `'editor'`.
- This ensures that only valid roles are passed to the database function, preventing the enum error.

## Testing and Debugging Tools

### OpenAI Testing Tools

MixerAI 2.0 includes a dedicated page for testing and debugging the Azure OpenAI integration at `/openai-test`. This page provides various tools to help developers:

- Test brand identity generation
- Test content generation
- Test Azure OpenAI connectivity

- **Auto-generate Feature**: Added workflow step description generation on both new and edit workflow pages
- **Culinary Role**: Added Culinary reviewer role for food content review
- **Footer and Release Notes**: Added application footer with release notes, privacy policy, and terms of service pages

## Brand Identity Generation

The application features a brand identity generation system that uses Azure OpenAI to analyze website URLs and generate comprehensive brand profiles.

### Brand Identity Generation Process

1. **URL Collection**: Users provide one or more URLs related to their brand
2. **AI Analysis**: The system analyzes the URLs to extract brand-related information
3. **Profile Generation**: A comprehensive brand profile is generated with:
   - Brand identity description
   - Tone of voice
   - Content guardrails
   - Recommended vetting agencies (with priority levels)
   - Suggested brand color (in hex format)

### Implementation Details

#### API Endpoints

- `/api/brands/identity` - Accepts brand name and URLs, returns generated brand identity content
- `/api/scrape-url` - Extracts content from URLs for analysis

#### Database Schema

The brands table includes these fields for storing brand identity information:

```sql
CREATE TABLE brands (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  website_url TEXT,
  website_urls TEXT, -- Stores multiple URLs as newline-separated strings
  country TEXT,
  language TEXT,
  brand_identity TEXT,
  tone_of_voice TEXT,
  guardrails TEXT,
  content_vetting_agencies TEXT,
  user_added_agencies JSONB, -- Stores custom agencies as JSON
  brand_color TEXT,
  approved_content_types JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Error Handling

The brand identity generation system includes several layers of error handling:

1. **Input Validation**: Validates brand name and URLs before processing
2. **API Fallbacks**: Falls back to template-based generation if OpenAI API fails
3. **JSON Parsing**: Robust parsing of AI responses with fallback mechanisms
4. **Default Values**: Provides sensible defaults for all fields if specific values can't be generated

### Regional Content Adaptation

A major enhancement to the brand identity generation system is the ability to adapt content based on regional context:

#### Country and Language Awareness

1. **Regional Context Parameters**:
   - The API now accepts `country` and `language` parameters
   - These parameters are used to generate region-specific content
   - Country codes are mapped to full country names for better context

2. **Localized Content Generation**:
   - Brand identity descriptions include country-specific references
   - Tone of voice recommendations adapt to regional communication styles
   - Content guardrails incorporate regional compliance considerations

3. **Country-Specific Vetting Agencies**:
   - The system provides relevant regulatory agencies based on country
   - Each country has its own set of recommended agencies
   - Agency priorities are adjusted based on brand industry and country
   - The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) is always set as high priority for UK brands

4. **Fallback Templates with Regional Context**:
   - When AI generation fails, fallback templates include regional references
   - Different industry templates are available (food, technology, health, fashion, general)
   - Each template incorporates country-specific elements when available

#### Technical Implementation

1. **Build-Time Detection**:
   - The API includes sophisticated build-time detection
   - During builds, mock data is returned to prevent API calls
   - This ensures successful builds even when external services are unavailable

2. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - Comprehensive logging throughout the generation process
   - Detailed error reporting for troubleshooting
   - Test script (`scripts/test-brand-identity.js`) for validating functionality

3. **URL Content Extraction**:
   - The `/api/scrape-url` endpoint extracts relevant content from brand websites
   - Extracts titles, descriptions, headings, and body content
   - Provides this information to the AI for more accurate brand analysis

### Recent Updates (August 2023)

- Enhanced brand identity generation with country and language context
- Fixed agency prioritization to ensure ASA always appears as high priority
- Implemented improved fallback templates with regional references
- Added comprehensive testing and debugging tools
- Created a dedicated URL scraping endpoint for website content extraction
- Improved error handling and logging throughout the generation process

## Brand Identity Multi-Language Support

The MixerAI 2.0 application now supports generating brand identity content in multiple languages based on the brand's country and language settings.

### Key Features

- **Language-Specific Generation**: Brand identity content is generated in the language specified in the brand settings
- **Explicit Language Instructions**: The OpenAI prompt now includes clear instructions to generate content in the specified language
- **Country-Language Awareness**: The system combines country and language information for more accurate localized content
- **UI Language Indicators**: The interface displays which language is being used for generation
- **Fallback Content Translation**: Even fallback templates now attempt to respect language preferences

### Technical Implementation

The language support is implemented through several components:

#### 1. API Prompt Enhancement

The `src/app/api/brands/identity/route.ts` now includes explicit language instructions in the OpenAI prompt:

```typescript
const userMessage = `Create a comprehensive brand identity profile for "${name}" based on the following website content:
    
${contents.map((content, i) => `URL ${i+1}: ${validUrls[i]}\n${content.substring(0, 500)}...\n`).join('\n')}

The brand operates in ${countryName} and communicates in ${language}.

IMPORTANT: Generate ALL content in the "${language}" language. The entire response must be written in this language.

// ... remaining prompt ...
```

#### 2. UI Language Indicators

The brand identity generation UI now shows which country and language the content will be generated for:

```tsx
<div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground mb-4 flex items-center">
  <Info className="h-3 w-3 mr-1" />
  <span>
    Content will be generated for {countryName} in {languageName}.
  </span>
</div>
```

#### 3. Response Handling

The response handling code has been updated to properly process content in any language:

```typescript
// Set brand with generated content
const updatedBrand = {
  ...brand,
  brand_identity: data.data.brandIdentity || '',
  tone_of_voice: data.data.toneOfVoice || '',
  guardrails: guardrailsContent,
  // ... other fields ...
};
```

### Benefits

- **Global Brand Support**: Better support for brands operating in non-English markets
- **Authentic Local Content**: Generated content that truly reflects local language and culture
- **Consistent Language Experience**: All brand identity elements (identity, tone, guardrails) in the same language
- **Improved AI Response Quality**: More accurate content by explicitly instructing the AI about language requirements

### Supported Languages

The system supports all languages available in the LANGUAGES constant, including but not limited to:

- English (various locales)
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Italian
- Portuguese
- Dutch
- And many more

The language selection is directly tied to the brand's language setting in the basic details tab.

## UI Consistency Between Brand Pages

We've ensured consistency between the brand creation and editing experiences:

### Standardized Layout
- Both `/brands/new` and `/brands/[id]/edit` pages now share identical layouts
- The same two-tab interface (Basic Details and Brand Identity)
- Consistent two-column layout in the Brand Identity tab

### Custom Agency Support
- Both pages now support adding, editing, and removing custom regulatory agencies
- Custom agencies include name, description, and priority settings
- Visual distinction between standard and custom agencies

### Error Handling Improvements
- Consistent handling of different response formats from the API
- Better fallback content generation with appropriate user notifications
- Clear validation messages for URL inputs
- Type-safe handling of guardrails content (array vs string)

## Content and Workflow Management

MixerAI 2.0 features a flexible Content Template System for creating diverse content types with AI assistance. Content then moves through configurable workflows for review and approval, with features like role-based assignments, user invitations for workflow steps, and AI-powered step description generation.

For comprehensive details, see:
- [Content Creation and Workflow Management Guide](./docs/content_and_workflows.md)
- [Content Template System Documentation](./docs/CONTENT_TEMPLATE_SYSTEM.md)
- [User Flows Documentation](./docs/user_flows.md)

## Navigation and Workflow Page Error Fix (YYYY-MM-DD)

A recent issue was identified where the content templates were not loading in the sidebar navigation's "Content" menu, and a related "Unknown error" was appearing on the `/dashboard/workflows` page.

### Problem
- The `unified-navigation.tsx` component was expecting an API response with a `templates` key when fetching content templates from `/api/content-templates`.
- The `/api/content-templates/route.ts` was returning the list of templates under a `data` key instead of `templates`.
- This mismatch caused the `fetchTemplates` function in `unified-navigation.tsx` to fail silently for the list, leading to an empty "Content" submenu and an "Unknown error" log when `data.error` was also undefined.

### Solution Implemented
- Modified `src/app/api/content-templates/route.ts` to change the response key from `data` to `templates` when returning all content templates.
  ```typescript
  // In src/app/api/content-templates/route.ts
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    success: true, 
    templates: templatesData // Changed from 'data: templatesData'
  });
  ```
- This change ensures that the frontend component `unified-navigation.tsx` receives the data in the expected format, allowing it to correctly populate the navigation and resolving the associated error on the workflows page.

## User Invitation System Enhancements

### Enhanced Error Handling

The `inviteNewUserWithAppMetadata` function has been enhanced to handle metadata update failures more robustly. If the metadata update fails, the function now attempts to delete the user to maintain security. If the deletion also fails, it logs the error for manual review and returns a critical error message.

### Testing Setup

Jest has been set up as the testing framework for the project. Test cases have been written for the `inviteNewUserWithAppMetadata` function to verify its functionality. These tests cover:

1. **Successful Invitation and Metadata Update:**
   - Verifies that a new user is invited and their `app_metadata` is updated successfully.

2. **Handling Metadata Update Failure:**
   - Tests the scenario where the metadata update fails, ensuring the user is deleted to maintain security.

The tests have been executed successfully, confirming the function's robustness.

### Project Documentation

The project documentation has been updated to reflect the current state of the user invitation system and related components. This includes details about the enhanced error handling and the testing setup.

## Database and Migrations

For comprehensive details on database connection methods, the full schema (including tables like `profiles`, `brands`, `content`, `workflows`, `user_brand_permissions`, `workflow_invitations`, etc.), Row Level Security (RLS) policies, and the migration strategy, please refer to the [Database Documentation](./docs/database.md).

## Content Lifecycle & Workflow Management

MixerAI 2.0 provides a comprehensive Content Lifecycle & Workflow Management system, enabling users to create, review, and publish content efficiently.

### Key Features

- **Content Templates**: Define the structure and fields for various content types (blog posts, social media updates, product descriptions, etc.)
- **Workflow Templates**: Create customizable workflows for content approval, including multi-step processes, role-based approvals, and content status tracking
- **Content Creation**: Utilize AI to generate content based on templates, with the ability to customize and refine the output
- **Workflow Assignment**: Assign content to workflows, with each workflow step having a specific role (editor, admin, etc.) and optional approval requirement
- **User Tasks**: Automatically create tasks for users assigned to workflow steps, allowing them to review and approve content
- **Email Notifications**: Send email notifications to users for task assignments, approvals, and rejections
- **Content Status Tracking**: Track the status of content throughout the workflow (draft, in review, approved, rejected, published)
- **Version History**: Maintain a version history for content, allowing users to revert to previous versions if needed
- **Content Archiving**: Archive content that is no longer needed, while keeping its version history for reference

### Workflow Initialization for New Content

When new content is created and associated with a workflow, its `current_step` is initialized to `0` (the index of the first step in the workflow's `steps` array) by the content creation UI.

A database trigger (`handle_new_content_workflow_assignment` on the `content` table) automatically creates tasks in the `user_tasks` table for all users assigned to this initial step (index 0) of the workflow.

(Actual content fields and lifecycle stages are defined by the `content` table, the chosen `content_template`, and the assigned `workflow`.)
