# MixerAI 2.0 Version Restoration Process

## Restored Version

- **Commit**: a055f1c05984c7d8f0d0d7909b6b54b6ed6a3e43
- **Commit Message**: "Fix API routes and Vercel deployment issues"
- **Date**: Fri May 2 17:19:40 2025 +0100

## Reason for Restoration

The codebase was restored to this version because it was the last known working state before database connection issues were encountered. This version has stable API routes and properly configured database connections.

## Restoration Process

1. Deleted previous restoration branch (`restore-a055f1c`)
2. Created a new branch from the target commit:
   ```bash
   git checkout a055f1c -b restore-version-a055f1c
   ```

## Next Steps

After restoration, the following tasks will be performed:

1. Test database connectivity with the working version
2. Implement improved error handling and diagnostics for database connections
3. Add comprehensive logging for all database operations
4. Create debugging tools to help identify connection issues

## Notes

This document was created to track the restoration process and provide context for future development. All subsequent changes should be made on the `restore-version-a055f1c` branch until stability is confirmed, at which point they can be merged back into the main branch.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Verify database connectivity
- [ ] Check API routes functionality
