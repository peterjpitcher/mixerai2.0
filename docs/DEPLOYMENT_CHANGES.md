# MixerAI 2.0 Deployment Changes

## Changes Made to Fix Deployment Issues

We've implemented the following changes to resolve the deployment error "Page '/api/workflows/[id]' is missing 'generateStaticParams()' so it cannot be used with 'output: export' config":

### 1. Removed Static Export Configuration

In `next.config.js`, we:
- Removed `output: 'export'` configuration
- Removed `unoptimized: true` from images config
- Removed `distDir: '.next'` setting
- Kept the experimental file tracing configuration

### 2. Updated Vercel Configuration

In `vercel.json`, we:
- Added `"framework": "nextjs"` to use Vercel's built-in Next.js support
- Removed custom build, install commands, and output directory settings
- Removed the rewrites configuration that was redirecting all requests to index.html
- Kept security headers for all routes

### 3. Updated Root Layout

In `src/app/layout.tsx`, we:
- Removed the API fallback script reference that was used for static exports
- Simplified the HTML structure

### 4. No Changes to Middleware

The middleware was already correctly configured to exclude API routes, so no changes were needed.

## Why These Changes Work

1. **Dynamic API Routes Support**: By removing the static export configuration, we enable Next.js to handle dynamic API routes properly at runtime rather than requiring pre-rendered static files.

2. **Server-Side Rendering**: This approach allows Next.js to use its built-in server-side rendering capabilities for dynamic content.

3. **Vercel Integration**: The `"framework": "nextjs"` setting in vercel.json tells Vercel to use its optimized Next.js deployment pipeline, which handles API routes and server components correctly.

## Testing the Deployment

After making these changes, we should:

1. Push the changes to the repository
2. Monitor the Vercel deployment to ensure it completes successfully
3. Test API routes to confirm they're working as expected
4. Verify that dynamic routes are functioning properly

## Future Considerations

If we encounter additional deployment issues, we might need to:

1. Check for any unconventional API route implementations
2. Ensure all environment variables are properly set in the Vercel project
3. Consider implementing proper error boundaries and fallback UIs for API failures

The application should now deploy successfully with full API functionality.
