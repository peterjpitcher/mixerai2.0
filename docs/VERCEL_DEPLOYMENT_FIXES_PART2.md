# Vercel Deployment Fixes - Part 2

This document describes the additional fixes needed for Vercel deployment after the "No serverless pages were built" error.

## Problem

After updating the configuration to use Next.js instead of the maintenance mode server, we encountered a new error:

```
Error: No serverless pages were built
Learn More: https://err.sh/vercel/vercel/now-next-no-serverless-pages-built
```

This error occurs because Vercel was unable to find the serverless functions in the Next.js build output.

## Solution

We made the following changes to fix the issue:

1. **Updated next.config.js**:
   - Added `output: 'standalone'` to tell Next.js to generate a standalone output format that works with Vercel

2. **Simplified vercel.json**:
   - Added `"framework": "nextjs"` to explicitly tell Vercel to use its Next.js integration
   - Removed custom build environment variables and commands
   - Kept only the security headers configuration

3. **Simplified the build script in package.json**:
   - Changed back to just `"build": "next build"` without the custom .net directory manipulation
   - This allows Vercel to handle the build process properly

4. **Added a .vercel.json file**:
   - Created a configuration file with the proper Next.js settings
   - Specified the output directory as `.next`

## Deployment Instructions

1. Push these changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add next.config.js vercel.json package.json .vercel.json
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - serverless pages error"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. In the Vercel dashboard:
   - Trigger a new deployment
   - Watch the logs to ensure it properly builds the Next.js application
   - Verify that all pages and API routes are available after deployment

## Why This Works

The previous approach tried to work around the `.net/routes-manifest.json` error by manually creating and populating this file. However, this introduced issues with how Vercel expected to find the serverless functions.

By setting `output: 'standalone'` in the Next.js config and letting Vercel handle the build process natively with its Next.js framework integration, we avoid the need for these workarounds and allow Vercel to correctly detect and deploy the application.
