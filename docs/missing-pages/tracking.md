## Next Steps

1. Prioritize the implementation of main listing pages:
   - `/dashboard/content/page.tsx`
   - `/dashboard/brands/page.tsx`
   - ~~`/dashboard/workflows/page.tsx`~~ (Already implemented)

2. Create shared components needed across multiple pages:
   - Sortable table component
   - Filter components
   - Action menu components
   - Form components for creation/editing

3. Implement creation pages:
   - `/dashboard/brands/new/page.tsx`
   - `/dashboard/content/new/page.tsx`
   - ~~`/dashboard/workflows/new/page.tsx`~~ (Already implemented)

4. Implement detail and edit pages in parallel
