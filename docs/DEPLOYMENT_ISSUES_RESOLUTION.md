# Deployment Issues Resolution

## Overview
This document outlines the steps taken to resolve the deployment issues encountered with the MixerAI 2.0 application on Vercel.

## Node.js Version Update
- Updated the Node.js version in Vercel settings to `18.x` to match the `package.json` configuration.

## Dependency Verification
- Verified that `react-server-dom-webpack` is not explicitly listed in `package.json`, aligning with the decision to let Next.js handle it transitively.
- Confirmed that `tailwindcss` is correctly listed under `devDependencies`.

## Module Resolution
- Checked the import paths in `src/app/account/page.tsx` and verified that the components (`button`, `card`, `input`, `label`) exist in the `src/components` directory.
- Ensured that the path alias configuration in `tsconfig.json` allows these imports to resolve correctly.

## Future Considerations
- Monitor Vercel deployment logs for any warnings or errors.
- Verify that React Server Components are working correctly.
- Keep React and React DOM versions in sync and let Next.js manage its internal dependencies.

This document captures the current resolution steps and provides a foundation for future troubleshooting and development.
