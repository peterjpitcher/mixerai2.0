# UI Review: Dashboard - My Tasks Page\n\n**Page:** `/dashboard/my-tasks`\n**File:** `src/app/dashboard/my-tasks/page.tsx`\n\n**Review Date:** October 25, 2023\n**Reviewer:** AI Assistant\n\nThis review assesses the My Tasks page against the UI standards documented in `docs/UI_STANDARDS.md`.\n\n## 0. Global Page Layout & Structure\n\n*   **0.1. Standard Page Regions:**\n    *   Global Header & Main Sidebar: Assumed handled by `layout.tsx`.\n    *   Main Content Area: Root `div` uses `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-6 space-y-6`. Adheres to **0.4 Consistent Padding**.\n*   **0.2. Overall Grid System:** The main data is displayed in a table within a Card.\n*   **0.3. Consistent Spacing Scale:** `space-y-6` for root. Consistent.\n*   **0.4. Page Width and Padding:** Handled correctly by the root `div`.\n\n## 1. Navigation & Structure\n\n*   **1.1. Consistent Breadcrumbs:**\n    *   **Presence & Content:** `Breadcrumbs` component: `items={[{ label: \"Dashboard\", href: \"/dashboard\" }, { label: \"My Tasks\" }]}`. Correct for a top-level section.\n    *   **Positioning:** Top of the content area.\n    *   **Note:** Placeholder `Breadcrumbs` component (Ref **1.1**).\n*   **1.2. Page Titles & Descriptions:**\n    *   **Page Title (`<h1>`):** `h1` with \"My Tasks\".\n    *   **Page Description (`<p>`):** \"Content items assigned to you that are currently active and require your action.\"\n    *   **Positioning:** Below breadcrumbs, left-aligned.\n*   **1.3. \"Back\" Buttons:** Not applicable for a main listing page.\n*   **1.4. \"Create New\" / Primary List Action Button:** Not applicable, as this page lists assigned tasks, not creatable entities.\n\n## 2. Branding & Contextual Information\n\n*   **2.3. Brand Avatar Usage Guidelines:**\n    *   In the tasks table, `BrandIcon` is used next to the `brand_name`. This is good for identifying the brand associated with each task.\n*   **2.4. Brand Colour Application Guidelines:**\n    *   `brand_color` is passed to `BrandIcon`. Assumed `BrandIcon` uses it appropriately. No other overt use of brand color, which is appropriate for this cross-brand task list.\n\n## 3. Forms & User Input\n\n*   Not applicable to this page as it\'s for display.\n\n## 4. Data Display (Lists, Tables, Detail Views)\n\n*   **4.1. Consistent Table Layout:**\n    *   Tasks are displayed in a `table` within a `Card`.\n    *   **Headers:** \"Content Title\", \"Brand\", \"Workflow Step\", \"Assigned On\", \"Actions\". Clear and left-aligned by default.\n    *   **Cell Alignment:** Text content is left-aligned. Date is left-aligned but styled as `text-muted-foreground`. Actions are in the rightmost column.\n    *   **Row Actions:** An \"Edit Content\" button (`<Edit />` icon + text) is provided, linking to the content edit page.\n    *   **Brand Identification:** Done with `BrandIcon` and brand name in a dedicated column, as per **4.1**.\n    *   **Sorting & Filtering:** No controls for sorting or filtering are visible on this page. For a task list, these could be useful (e.g., sort by date, filter by brand). (Ref: **4.1**)\n    *   The table is wrapped in `div className=\"overflow-x-auto\"` which is a good simple way to handle responsiveness for tables on small screens, as per **5.1 Table Adaptation**.\n*   **4.3. Empty States:**\n    *   **Presence & Content:** If `tasks.length === 0`:
        *   `ListChecks` icon.\n        *   \"All caught up!\" title.\n        *   \"You have no pending tasks assigned to you.\" description.\n    *   This is a well-designed and friendly empty state.\n    *   **Positioning:** Centered within a `Card`.
*   **4.4. Loading Indicators for Data Areas:**\n    *   **Page Load:** `Loader2` icon is shown while `isLoading` is true. (Good)\n    *   **Error State:** `AlertCircle` icon, error message, and \"Retry\" button if `error` is set. (Good)\n*   **4.5. Consistent Iconography:**\n    *   Uses `lucide-react` icons: `Eye`, `Edit`, `AlertCircle`, `ListChecks`, `Loader2`. `BrandIcon` also used. Consistent.\n    *   \"Edit Content\" button pairs icon with text.\n*   **4.6. Date & Time Formatting:**\n    *   `formatDate` function using `date-fns` to format `created_at` as `dd MMMM yyyy`. Adheres to **4.6**. Error handling is present.\n\n## 5. Mobile & Responsive Standards\n\n*   **5.1. Responsive Layout Principles:**\n    *   **Table Adaptation:** Uses `overflow-x-auto` for the table, which is a valid approach for responsiveness, ensuring content is not cut off, though horizontal scrolling might be needed on small screens.\n*   **5.2. Touch-Friendly Target Sizes:** Buttons appear reasonably sized. Table rows themselves are not primary tap targets, but the action button within is.\n\n## 6. General UI & UX\n\n*   **6.1. - 6.3.** Typography, Color Palette, Interaction States: Assumed handled by global styles and component library. Needs visual check for table row hover, button states.\n*   **6.5. Notifications & Toasts:** `toast.error` used for authentication/fetch errors.\n*   **6.7. Accessibility (A11Y):**\n    *   Content titles in the table are links. Ensure link text is descriptive. `task.content_title || \'N/A\'` is used; \'N/A\' is not ideal link text if the title is truly missing.\n    *   Table headers (`<th>`) are used correctly. Consider adding `scope=\"col\"` to `<th>` elements for explicit column header association.\n    *   `BrandIcon` accessibility (alt text/role) needs to be ensured.\n\n## Issues & Recommendations\n\n1.  **Medium:** The table displaying tasks lacks sorting and filtering capabilities. For a potentially long list of tasks, these features would significantly improve usability. (Ref: **4.1 Sorting & Filtering**)\n2.  **Minor:** The `Breadcrumbs` component is a local placeholder. (Ref: **1.1**)\n3.  **Minor/Accessibility:** If a `task.content_title` can genuinely be missing, the fallback \"N/A\" as link text is not ideal. Consider a more descriptive placeholder or alternative display if the title is absent. (Ref: **6.7**)\n4.  **Minor/Accessibility:** Add `scope=\"col\"` to table header cells (`<th>`) for better screen reader support.\n5.  **Check:** Visually confirm hover states for table rows and interaction states for buttons. (Ref: **6.3**)\n6.  **Check:** Verify `BrandIcon` accessibility. (Ref: **2.3, 6.7**)\n
## Overall Assessment\n\nThe `src/app/dashboard/my-tasks/page.tsx` page is **well-structured and largely adheres** to the UI standards. It presents a clear list of tasks in a table, with appropriate loading, empty, and error states. Date formatting and brand identification are correctly implemented.\n\nThe main area for improvement is the addition of sorting and filtering for the task list to enhance usability for users with many tasks. Minor accessibility improvements for table headers and link text fallbacks would also be beneficial.\n
