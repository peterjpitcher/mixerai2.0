# UI Review: Dashboard - User Detail Page\n\n**Page:** `/dashboard/users/[id]`\n**File:** `src/app/dashboard/users/[id]/page.tsx`\n\n**Review Date:** October 25, 2023\n**Reviewer:** AI Assistant\n\nThis review assesses the User Detail page against the UI standards documented in `docs/UI_STANDARDS.md`.\n\n## 0. Global Page Layout & Structure\n\n*   **0.1. Standard Page Regions:**\n    *   Global Header & Main Sidebar: Assumed handled by `layout.tsx`.\n    *   Main Content Area: Root `div` uses `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-6 space-y-8`. This adheres to **0.4 Consistent Padding**.\n*   **0.2. Overall Grid System:** Content is organized into cards. Within the \"Profile Information\" card, a responsive grid (`md:grid-cols-2`) is used for key-value pairs.\n*   **0.3. Consistent Spacing Scale:** `space-y-8` for main sections, `space-y-4` within cards. Consistent.\n*   **0.4. Page Width and Padding:** Handled correctly by the root `div`.\n\n## 1. Navigation & Structure\n\n*   **1.1. Consistent Breadcrumbs:**\n    *   **Presence & Content:** `Breadcrumbs` component used: `Dashboard > Users > [User Name/Email]`. Path is correct, current page (user name) is not linked.\n    *   **Note:** Placeholder `Breadcrumbs` component (Ref **1.1**).\n*   **1.2. Page Titles & Descriptions:**\n    *   **Page Title (`<h1>`):** `h1` displays the user\'s full name or email.\n    *   **Page Description (`<p>`):** \"Details for {user.email}.\"\n    *   **Positioning:** Grouped with Back button, below breadcrumbs. Good.\n*   **1.3. \"Back\" Buttons:**\n    *   **Presence:** `ArrowLeft` icon button.\n    *   **Functionality:** Navigates to `/dashboard/users`. Good.\n    *   **Positioning:** Top-left, part of page header group. Excellent.\n*   **1.4. \"Create New\" / Primary List Action Button:** Not applicable. Actions are \"Edit User\" and \"Delete User\".\n    *   **Edit User Button:** Links to `/dashboard/users/[id]/edit`. Icon and text are clear.\n    *   **Delete User Button:** Styled destructively, with icon and text. Opens a confirmation dialog.\n    *   **Positioning:** Top-right, aligned with page title area. Good for page-level actions.\n\n## 2. Branding & Contextual Information\n\n*   **2.3. Brand Avatar Usage Guidelines:**\n    *   In the \"Brand Permissions\" card, `BrandIcon` is used next to each brand name. This is good for identifying associated brands.\n*   **2.4. Brand Colour Application Guidelines:**\n    *   `brand_color` is passed to `BrandIcon`. Assumed appropriate usage within the component.\n
## 3. Forms & User Input\n\n*   Not applicable for this view-only page.\n
## 4. Data Display (Lists, Tables, Detail Views)\n\n*   **User Profile Information:** Displayed as key-value pairs within a `Card`. Uses `Label` for keys and paragraph text for values. `Badge` for System Role. Clear and well-organized.\n*   **Brand Permissions:** Displayed as a list of items within a `Card`. Each item shows `BrandIcon`, brand name, and the user\'s role for that brand (as a `Badge`). Clear and structured (**4.2**).
*   **4.3. Empty States:**\n    *   If `user.brand_permissions` is empty: \"This user has no specific brand permissions assigned.\" (Good)
    *   If user is not found after loading: Shows \"User Not Found\" state with `AlertCircle` icon and a button to go back to the users list. (Excellent)
*   **4.4. Loading Indicators for Data Areas:**\n    *   **Page Load:** Displays \"Loading User Details...\" with a `Loader2` spinner. (Good)
*   **4.5. Consistent Iconography:** Uses `lucide-react` icons: `UserCircle2`, `ArrowLeft`, `Edit`, `Trash2`, `AlertCircle`, `Loader2`, `BrandIcon`. Consistent.\n*   **4.6. Date & Time Formatting:**\n    *   `created_at` and `last_sign_in_at` formatted using `formatDateFns(date, \'dd MMMM yyyy\')`. Adheres to **4.6**. Fallback to \"Never\" for `last_sign_in_at`. Error handling for date formatting is not explicitly shown but assumed if using a robust utility.\n
## 5. Mobile & Responsive Standards\n\n*   **5.1. Responsive Layout Principles:** Profile information uses `md:grid-cols-2`, which will stack on smaller screens. List of brand permissions will stack naturally. Assumed good.\n
## 6. General UI & UX\n\n*   **6.1. - 6.3.** Typography, Color Palette, Interaction States: Assumed handled by global styles and component library. Needs visual check.\n*   **6.4. Modals & Pop-ups (Dialogs):**\n    *   `Dialog` (via `AlertDialog` components) for delete confirmation (`showDeleteDialog`).\n        *   **Structure:** `DialogTitle`, `DialogDescription`, `AlertDialogCancel`, `AlertDialogAction`. Good.\n        *   **Action Buttons:** Destructive action button styled appropriately (`bg-destructive`). Loading state (`isDeleting`) handled. Good implementation.\n*   **6.5. Notifications & Toasts:** `toast` used for errors (user not found, fetch errors, delete errors) and success (delete success).\n*   **6.7. Accessibility (A11Y):**\n    *   Back button has `aria-label`. `BrandIcon` needs accessibility check (as per previous reviews).\n    *   Labels are used for key-value pairs in profile info. Ensure they are correctly associated if data were inputs (though here they are for display).\n
## Issues & Recommendations\n\n1.  **Minor:** The `Breadcrumbs` component is a local placeholder. (Ref: **1.1**)\n2.  **Check:** Verify `BrandIcon` accessibility (alt text or ARIA attributes). (Ref: **2.3**)\n3.  **Check:** Visually confirm hover, focus, and active states for all interactive elements (`Button`, links, list items if interactive). (Ref: **6.3**)\n4.  **Low:** Page title metadata (`// export const metadata...`) is commented out.\n
## Overall Assessment\n\nThe `src/app/dashboard/users/[id]/page.tsx` (User Detail Page) is **well-structured and aligns effectively** with UI standards. It clearly presents user information and brand permissions. Navigation, actions (edit, delete with confirmation), and loading/error/not found states are well handled.\n\nMinor points are mostly around placeholder components and standard checks. This is a solid user detail page implementation.
