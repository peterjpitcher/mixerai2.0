# UI Review: Component - TemplateForm\n\n**Component:** `<TemplateForm />`\n**File:** `src/components/template/template-form.tsx`\n\n**Review Date:** October 25, 2023\n**Reviewer:** AI Assistant\n\nThis review assesses the `TemplateForm` component against the UI standards documented in `docs/UI_STANDARDS.md`, focusing on form-related aspects.\n\n## 0. Global Page Layout & Structure\n\n*   This component is part of a page, so it doesn\'t define global layout. It uses `Card` components to structure its content, which is good for modularity within a page.\n*   **0.3. Consistent Spacing Scale:** The form uses `space-y-6` for the main form sections (Cards). Within cards, `space-y-4` for content, `space-y-3` for field lists. Tabs content has `mt-4`. CardFooter has `pt-6`. Appears consistent.\n\n## 3. Forms & User Input (Primary Focus)\n\n*   **Overall Form Structure:** The form is wrapped in a `<form>` tag with `onSubmit={handleSubmit}`. Content is organized into `Card` sections: \"Basic Information\" and \"Field Configuration\". This is clear.\n*   **3.1. Standard Action Buttons & Positioning in Forms:**\n    *   **Primary Action:** Dynamically labeled \"Save Changes\" or \"Create Template\".\n    *   **Secondary Action:** \"Cancel\" button (navigates to templates list).\n    *   **Positioning:** Both are in a `CardFooter` at the end of the form, right-aligned (Primary to the right of Secondary). This adheres to **3.1**.\n    *   **Button Grouping:** The main save/cancel buttons are grouped.\n*   **3.2. Field Labels:**\n    *   **Presence:** `Label` components are used for \"Template Name\" and \"Description\".\n    *   **Positioning:** Correctly above their respective inputs.\n    *   For dynamically added fields within `FieldDesigner` (covered separately), labels are also expected.\n*   **3.3. Placeholder Text:**\n    *   Used effectively: e.g., \"e.g., Blog Post Template\" for Template Name.\n*   **3.4. Helper/Instructional Text:** Not explicitly used for the basic info fields, but `CardDescription` provides context.\n*   **3.5. Required Field Indication:**\n    *   The \"Template Name\" `Input` has the `required` HTML attribute. However, UI standards (**3.5**) also recommend a visual cue like an asterisk `*` next to the label.\n    *   Validation checks for name, input fields, and output fields via toasts, but no persistent visual markers.\n*   **3.6. Consistent Input Styling:** Uses standard components (`Input`, `Textarea`, `Button`, `Tabs`) from `@/components/` which should provide consistent styling.\n*   **3.7. Validation Messages:**\n    *   Validation (`handleSubmit`) uses `toast.error` for: missing name, no input fields, no output fields. This is global feedback, not inline as recommended by **3.7**.\n*   **3.8. Loading/Saving States for Buttons:**\n    *   The submit button shows an `Icons.spinner` and changes text when `isSubmitting`. Button is disabled. This is good.\n\n## Field Configuration Section (within `TemplateForm`)\n\n*   **Tabs:** Uses `Tabs` for \"Input Fields\" and \"Output Fields\". Clear separation.\n*   **Drag and Drop:** Uses `@hello-pangea/dnd` for reordering fields. This is a good UX feature for lists.\n*   **Display of Fields:** Each draggable field item shows name, type, and required status. \"Edit\" and \"Delete\" (`Icons.trash`) buttons are provided per item.\n    *   The delete icon button is icon-only and should have an `aria-label` for accessibility (Standard **4.5** on tooltips/labels for icon buttons).
*   **Adding Fields:** \"Add Input Field\" / \"Add Output Field\" buttons are present below each list.\n*   **`FieldDesigner` Component:** This is a modal (dialog) used for adding/editing individual fields. It will need its own review, especially against **3. Forms & User Input** and **6.4 Modals & Pop-ups**.\n
## 4. Data Display (Lists, Tables, Detail Views - for field lists)\n\n*   **4.2. List Views:** Field lists are scrollable (`ScrollArea`) and use a custom draggable item layout.\n*   **4.5. Consistent Iconography:** `Icons.trash`, `Icons.spinner` are used. `Menu` icon from `lucide-react` is imported but not visibly used in this specific component\'s render. `FieldDesigner` will have its own icons.\n
## 6. General UI & UX\n\n*   **6.3. Interaction Feedback States (Hover, Focus, Active):** Needs visual check for all interactive elements (buttons, tabs, draggable items).\n*   **6.5. Notifications & Toasts:** `toast` from `sonner` is used well for submit actions and validation errors.\n
## Issues & Recommendations\n\n1.  **High (Deferred):** The `<FieldDesigner />` component, used as a modal for adding/editing fields, needs a full separate review against UI Standards sections 3 (Forms & User Input), 6.4 (Modals), and relevant parts of 4, 5, and 6.\n2.  **Medium:** Required field visual indication: The \"Template Name\" field (and likely fields within `FieldDesigner`) should have a visual asterisk `*` next to its `Label` as per **3.5** in addition to the `required` attribute.\n3.  **Medium:** Validation messages for missing name/input fields/output fields are shown via global toasts. Standard **3.7** recommends inline validation messages for more direct feedback below or near the relevant input/area.\n4.  **Minor/Accessibility:** The delete icon button (`<Icons.trash />`) for each field in the draggable list is icon-only and lacks an `aria-label`. Add `aria-label=\"Delete field\"` or similar. (Ref: **4.5**)
5.  **Check:** Visually confirm hover, focus, and active states for all interactive elements. (Ref: **6.3**)
\n## Overall Assessment\n\nThe `TemplateForm` component provides a good structure for creating and editing templates. It uses cards and tabs effectively to organize complex information. The drag-and-drop for fields is a nice UX touch. The main save/cancel actions are correctly positioned and provide good feedback.\n\nThe primary areas for improvement, consistent with other forms reviewed, are the visual indication of required fields and the use of inline validation messages. The accessibility of icon-only buttons also needs attention. The heavy lifting for individual field configuration is deferred to the `FieldDesigner` component, which is critical for the overall usability of this form.\n
