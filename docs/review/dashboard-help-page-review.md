# UI Review: Dashboard - Help Wiki Page\n\n**Page:** `/dashboard/help`\n**File:** `src/app/dashboard/help/page.tsx`\n\n**Review Date:** October 25, 2023\n**Reviewer:** AI Assistant\n\nThis review assesses the Help Wiki page against the UI standards documented in `docs/UI_STANDARDS.md`.\n\n## 0. Global Page Layout & Structure\n\n*   **0.1. Standard Page Regions:**\n    *   Global Header & Main Sidebar: Assumed handled by `layout.tsx`.\n    *   Main Content Area: Root `div` uses `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-6`. Adheres to **0.4 Consistent Padding**.\n    *   The page implements a two-column layout (sidebar for topics, main area for article content) using flexbox (`flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-8`).\n*   **0.2. Overall Grid System:** Not a strict grid for the main content, but the two-column flex layout is responsive.\n*   **0.3. Consistent Spacing Scale:** `gap-8` for columns, `space-y-2` for nav links, `space-y-8` in main. Appears consistent.\n*   **0.4. Page Width and Padding:** Handled correctly by the root `div`. Main content within `<main>` uses `flex-1`, correctly taking available space.\n\n## 1. Navigation & Structure\n\n*   **1.1. Consistent Breadcrumbs:**\n    *   **Presence & Content:** `Breadcrumbs` component used. Items are dynamically built: `Dashboard > Help Wiki` or `Dashboard > Help Wiki > [Article Title]` if viewing a specific article other than the default. This is good.\n    *   The current article title in breadcrumbs is not linked. Good.\n    *   Uses `ChevronRight` as separator, which is different from the `/` used in the placeholder definition. The standard is `/`. This version of `Breadcrumbs` component seems to be a local one as well.\n    *   **Positioning:** Top of the page.\n*   **1.2. Page Titles & Descriptions:**\n    *   **Page Title (`<h1>`):** There isn\'t a single overarching `<h1>` for \"Help Wiki\" at the top of the main content area. The article title within the `Card` is a `CardTitle` (likely `<h2>` or `<h3>` by default from Shadcn, rendered as `text-2xl font-bold`). Standard **1.2** recommends a clear `<h1>` for the page. The current `<h2>Help Topics</h2>` is for the sidebar.\n    *   **Page Description (`<p>`):** No general page description below a main `<h1>`. The `metadata.description` is set, which is good for SEO/browser tabs.\n*   **1.3. \"Back\" Buttons:** Not explicitly present. Navigation is via breadcrumbs and sidebar links.\n*   **1.4. Primary List Action Button:** Not applicable.\n*   **1.5. Main Sidebar Navigation (Contextual - Help Topics):**\n    *   A contextual sidebar (`<aside>`) lists help topics (article titles).\n    *   `h2` for \"Help Topics\".\n    *   Links styled with `block p-2 rounded-md text-sm hover:bg-accent...`.
    *   Active article is highlighted: `bg-accent font-semibold text-accent-foreground`. This is good active state indication.\n
## 4. Data Display (Lists, Tables, Detail Views)\n\n*   **Article Content Display:**\n    *   Displayed within a `Card`. `CardHeader` contains `CardTitle` (article title).\n    *   `CardContent` uses `ReactMarkdown` with `remarkGfm` to render markdown content. `prose prose-sm max-w-none` classes are used for styling, which is good for readability of markdown.\n*   **4.3. Empty States:**\n    *   If `currentArticleContent` is null (article not found):\n        *   Displays a `Card` with \"Content Not Found\" title.\n        *   Message: \"The help article you are looking for could not be found...\"\n        *   Button: \"Back to Help Overview\" linking to `/dashboard/help` (the default view).\n    *   This is a good and helpful empty/error state for missing content.\n*   **4.4. Loading Indicators:** This page is a Server Component. Data fetching (`getHelpArticles`, `getHelpArticleContent`) happens server-side. Next.js handles streaming/loading states for Server Components. No specific client-side loading indicators are needed for the content itself once the page is rendered.\n
## 6. General UI & UX\n\n*   **6.1. Typography System:** `prose prose-sm` aims to provide good typography for markdown. Overall typography depends on global styles.\n*   **6.7. Accessibility (A11Y):**\n    *   Markdown content accessibility depends on the markdown itself (e.g., correct heading structure, alt text for images within markdown).\n    *   Navigation links in sidebar are clear. Active state is visually distinct.\n
## Issues & Recommendations\n\n1.  **Medium:** The page lacks a main `<h1>` title at the top of the content area as per standard **1.2**. While the article title is prominent, a general page title like \"Help & Support\" or \"Help Wiki\" as an `<h1>` would be beneficial for overall page structure and accessibility. The current breadcrumbs imply \"Help Wiki\" is the main page title.\n2.  **Minor:** The local `Breadcrumbs` component uses `ChevronRight` as a separator, while the standard (and the component\'s own placeholder code) uses `/`. This should be consistent. Consider using a globally defined Breadcrumbs component if available.\n3.  **Check:** Ensure the `CardTitle` for the article title renders with an appropriate heading level (e.g., `<h2>` if the main page title is `<h1>`) for semantic HTML structure.\n4.  **Check:** Visually confirm hover/focus states for sidebar navigation links. (Ref: **6.3**)\n
## Overall Assessment\n\nThe `src/app/dashboard/help/page.tsx` provides a good foundation for a help wiki. Its two-column layout is clear, and the use of markdown for content is flexible. The handling of missing articles is good. The server-side data fetching simplifies client-side state management for content loading.\n\nThe main improvements would be to add a standard page `<h1>` title and ensure consistency in breadcrumb styling. The functionality of displaying articles and navigating between them is well-implemented.\n
