# UI Standards Review: `src/app/dashboard/claims/preview/page.tsx` (Claims Preview & Matrix)

Date: 2024-07-26

This document outlines the findings from a UI standards review of the "Claims Preview & Matrix" page (`src/app/dashboard/claims/preview/page.tsx`) against `docs/UI_STANDARDS.md`.

## Overall Assessment

This is a complex and feature-rich page designed for viewing and managing a claims matrix. It includes dynamic filtering, a detailed matrix display with visual cues for claim statuses, modal dialogs for market overrides, and a full-screen mode. The page makes good use of shared components and handles various states effectively.

## Compliance with UI Standards

### Compliant Sections:

*   **0.3. Consistent Spacing Scale & 0.4. Page Width and Padding:** Adhered to, with special handling for full-screen mode.
*   **1.1. Consistent Breadcrumbs:** Uses shared `Breadcrumbs` component (`Dashboard > Claims Preview & Matrix`).
*   **1.2. Page Titles & Descriptions:** Uses shared `PageHeader` with dynamic title and description based on filters.
*   **4.1. Consistent Table Layout (Claims Matrix):** The matrix is a complex table with sticky headers for rows (Claim Text) and columns (Products). Cells use icons and background colours to denote status.
*   **4.1.5. Filtering Controls:** Prominent filters for Country and Brand are provided above the matrix.
*   **4.3. Empty States:** Handles loading, error, no products, and no claims states for the matrix display.
*   **4.4. Loading Indicators:** Clear loading states for the matrix and initial filter data.
*   **4.5. Consistent Iconography:** Extensive use of Lucide icons for statuses, actions, filters. `claimTypeDisplayInfo` defines status icons.
*   **Tooltips (4.5):** Tooltips are used on matrix cells to provide detailed information.
*   **6.4. Modals & Pop-ups (Dialogs):** A `Dialog` (`OverrideModalContent`) is used for managing market overrides, with clear structure, title, description, and actions.
*   **6.7. Accessibility (A11Y) - Semantic HTML:** Uses table elements, shared components.

### Partially Compliant / Needs Clarification / Areas for Improvement:

*   **Accessibility of Colour Coding (Standard 2.4.1 / 6.7):**
    *   **Observation:** Matrix cells use background colours (e.g., `bg-green-200`) based on `claimTypeDisplayInfo` to indicate claim status. Icons are also present in cells.
    *   **Standard 2.4.1 Principle:** Colour should not be the sole means of conveying information. While icons are present, their visual prominence relative to the background colour, especially for users with colour vision deficiencies, is important.
    *   **Recommendation:** Ensure that the icons are the primary conveyor of status information and have sufficient contrast against their respective cell backgrounds. The current approach of pairing icons with colours is good; focus on the icon clarity and distinctiveness.
*   **Local Components (`MatrixDisplayCell`, `OverrideModalContent`):**
    *   **Observation:** These are substantial, page-specific components defined within the same file.
    *   **Recommendation:** For better code organization and maintainability, consider moving these complex components into their own files (e.g., under `src/components/claims/preview/`).
*   **Tooltip Readability (Standard 4.5 / 6.1):**
    *   **Observation:** Tooltips on matrix cells contain multiple lines of text, including bolded text and descriptions.
    *   **Recommendation:** Ensure the font sizes, line heights, and overall styling within these tooltips provide good readability, adhering to the application's typographic scale and accessibility best practices.

### Other Observations:

*   **Full-Screen Mode:** A valuable UX enhancement for this data-dense page. The toggle mechanism is clear.
*   **Dynamic Content:** Page title, description, and matrix data update dynamically based on filter selections.
*   **Complexity Management:** The page attempts to manage a high degree of complexity. The clear separation of filters, matrix, and modal for overrides is well-handled.

## Summary of Recommendations:

1.  **Verify Accessibility of Colour Coding (2.4.1, 6.7):** Confirm that icons in matrix cells are the primary indicators of status and have high contrast against their backgrounds, with colour providing secondary reinforcement.
2.  **Refactor Local Components:** For improved code structure, consider moving `MatrixDisplayCell` and `OverrideModalContent` to separate component files.
3.  **Ensure Tooltip Readability (4.5, 6.1):** Check that the typography and styling of multi-line tooltips ensure easy readability.

This page is a sophisticated tool within the dashboard. The primary focus for UI standards alignment is on ensuring the accessibility of its complex visual display and maintaining code organization.
