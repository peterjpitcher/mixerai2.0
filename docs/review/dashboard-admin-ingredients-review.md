# UI Standards Review: `src/app/dashboard/admin/ingredients/`

Date: 2024-07-26

This document outlines the findings from a UI standards review of the `src/app/dashboard/admin/ingredients/` directory structure.

## Overall Assessment

The directory structure for "Ingredients" within the admin section appears to be incomplete or a placeholder, similar to other sections noted within `admin`.

## Directory Structure Observed:

*   `src/app/dashboard/admin/ingredients/`
    *   `new/` (empty)
    *   `[id]/`
        *   `edit/` (empty)

## Findings:

*   **No Listing Page:** There is no `page.tsx` file at `src/app/dashboard/admin/ingredients/` which would typically serve as the listing page for ingredients.
*   **No "Create New" Page:** The `src/app/dashboard/admin/ingredients/new/` directory, intended for creating a new ingredient, is empty.
*   **No "View Details" Page:** There is no `page.tsx` directly within `src/app/dashboard/admin/ingredients/[id]/` for viewing the details of a specific ingredient.
*   **No "Edit" Page:** The `src/app/dashboard/admin/ingredients/[id]/edit/` directory, intended for the edit page, is empty.

## Conclusion based on UI Standards (`docs/UI_STANDARDS.md`):

Due to the absence of actual page files (`page.tsx`), a UI review against the standards document cannot be performed for this section.

If this section were implemented, key UI standards would apply, including:

*   **1.1. Consistent Breadcrumbs**
*   **1.2. Page Titles & Descriptions**
*   **1.3. "Back" Buttons**
*   **1.4. "Create New" / Primary List Action Button** (for the listing page)
*   **3. Forms & User Input** (for create/edit pages)
*   **4. Data Display** (for the listing page and view details page)

## Recommendation:

*   If "Ingredients" management is an intended admin feature, the necessary `page.tsx` files for listing, creating, viewing, and editing need to be implemented.
*   If this feature is deprecated or not yet ready, consider removing the placeholder directory structure.

This section requires development before a UI standards review can be meaningful.
