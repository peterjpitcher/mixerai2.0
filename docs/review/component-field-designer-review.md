# UI Review: Component - FieldDesigner\n\n**Component:** `<FieldDesigner />`\n**File:** `src/components/template/field-designer.tsx`\n\n**Review Date:** October 25, 2023\n**Reviewer:** AI Assistant\n\nThis review assesses the `FieldDesigner` component, which functions as a modal dialog for adding or editing fields within the `TemplateForm`.\n\n## 6.4. Modals & Pop-ups (Dialogs) (Primary Focus)\n\n*   **Purposeful Use:** The component is used as a `Dialog` for the focused task of configuring a single field. This is an appropriate use of a modal.\n*   **Structure & Dismissal:**\n    *   Uses `Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogFooter, DialogDescription` from `@/components/dialog` (presumably Shadcn/ui).
    *   **Title:** Dynamic: `\"Add\" | \"Edit\"} {\"Input\" | \"Output\"} Field`.
    *   **Description:** Static: \"Configure the details for this field. Use the tabs to navigate between settings.\"\n    *   **Dismissal:** The `Dialog` component typically handles Escape key and overlay click for dismissal. A \"Cancel\" button is also provided in the `DialogFooter`. This is good.\n*   **Action Buttons (within modal):**\n    *   **Primary Action:** \"Save Field\" button.\n    *   **Secondary Action:** \"Cancel\" button.\n    *   **Positioning:** Both are in `DialogFooter`, right-aligned (Save Field to the right of Cancel). Adheres to **3.1** as applied to modals via **6.4**.\n*   **Overlay:** Standard `Dialog` behavior should include an overlay.\n*   **Content Organization:** Uses `Tabs` (Basic Info, Options, AI Features) to organize the field configuration, which is good for managing complexity within the modal.\n\n## 3. Forms & User Input (within the Modal)\n\n*   **3.2. Field Labels:** `Label` components are used for \"Field Name\", \"Field Type\", and various options within each tab (e.g., \"Minimum Length\", \"AI Prompt\"). Correctly positioned above inputs.\n*   **3.3. Placeholder Text:** Used for \"Field Name\" (`e.g., Article Title`), AI Prompt, and some option inputs. Good examples.\n*   **3.4. Helper/Instructional Text:**\n    *   AI Prompt section has helper text with an `Info` icon and a link to docs: \"You can use placeholders... Learn more.\" This is excellent.\n    *   AI Features for Input/Output fields have descriptive paragraphs.\n*   **3.5. Required Field Indication:**\n    *   No visual asterisks `*` next to labels for required fields like \"Field Name\" or conditional AI Prompt. Validation catches these with toasts, but visual cues are missing.\n*   **3.6. Consistent Input Styling:** Uses standard components (`Input`, `Select`, `Checkbox`, `Textarea`) which should be consistent.\n*   **3.7. Validation Messages:**\n    *   `validateField()` function shows `sonnerToast.error` for missing field name or AI prompt. This is global feedback. As per **3.7**, inline messages would be better, though for modals, a toast upon save attempt is common. Switching active tab on error (e.g., `setActiveTab(\'ai\')`) is a good UX touch to guide the user.\n*   **3.8. Loading/Saving States for Buttons:** Not directly applicable as this modal saves to parent state, but the parent form (`TemplateForm`) has submit button loading states.\n\n## Specific UI Elements within FieldDesigner Tabs\n\n*   **Basic Info Tab:** Field Name (Input), Field Type (Select), Required (Checkbox with Label). Clear and standard.\n*   **Options Tab:** Dynamically renders different inputs based on `fieldData.type`. Uses `Label` and `Input` for various options. For `select` type, allows adding/deleting choices with an `Icons.trash` icon button for deletion.\n    *   The delete choice button is icon-only and needs an `aria-label` (Ref **4.5**).\n*   **AI Features Tab:**\n    *   Conditional checkboxes for features like \"Enable AI Suggestions\", \"Use Brand Identity\".\n    *   `Textarea` for \"AI Prompt\".\n    *   Buttons to insert placeholders (`{{inputFieldName}}`, `{{brand.name}}`) into the AI prompt. This is a very good UX feature.\n
## 4. Data Display & Iconography (within the Modal)\n\n*   **4.5. Consistent Iconography:** `Icons.trash` (for select choices), `Info` (for AI prompt helper). `Rocket` is imported but not used. Assumed `Icons` are from a consistent library.\n\n## 6. General UI & UX (within the Modal)\n\n*   **6.3. Interaction Feedback States:** Needs visual check for all elements.\n*   **6.5. Notifications & Toasts:** `sonnerToast` is used for validation errors.\n*   **6.7. Accessibility (A11Y):**\n    *   Uses `Dialog` from `@/components/dialog` which should be accessible (handles focus trapping, ARIA attributes for dialog role, etc.).\n    *   Labels are associated with inputs via `htmlFor` and `id`.
    *   Checkboxes are associated with labels.\n    *   Link to docs in AI Prompt helper text has `target=\"_blank\"` which is fine but consider adding `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"` for security/performance if not already handled globally.

## Issues & Recommendations\n\n1.  **Medium:** Required field visual indication: Fields like \"Field Name\" and the conditional AI Prompt (when AI features are enabled) should have a visual asterisk `*` next to their `Label` as per **3.5**.\n2.  **Medium:** Validation messages are via global toasts. Consider if brief inline messages near the field (or a summary at the top of the modal) could be added on save attempt, in addition to or instead of just toasts for a better UX within the modal, though toasts are acceptable for modal validation (Ref **3.7**). The tab switching on error is good.\n3.  **Minor/Accessibility:** The delete icon button (`<Icons.trash />`) for removing choices in the \'select\' field type options is icon-only and lacks an `aria-label`. Add `aria-label=\"Delete choice\"` or similar. (Ref: **4.5**)\n4.  **Check:** Visually confirm hover, focus, and active states for all interactive elements within the dialog. (Ref: **6.3**)\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\nThe `FieldDesigner` component is a well-structured and user-friendly modal for configuring template fields. Its use of tabs to organize settings is effective. The AI prompt helper with placeholder insertion buttons is a strong UX feature.\n
Key improvements align with common themes: visual indication of required fields and potentially more localized validation messages. Accessibility of icon-only buttons needs a minor fix. Overall, it adheres well to the UI standards for modals and forms within them.\n
