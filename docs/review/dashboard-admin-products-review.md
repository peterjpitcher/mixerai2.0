# UI Standards Review: `src/app/dashboard/admin/products/`

Date: 2024-07-26

This document outlines the findings from a UI standards review of the `src/app/dashboard/admin/products/` directory structure.

## Overall Assessment

The directory structure for "Products" within the admin section appears to be an incomplete placeholder. It mirrors the empty pattern seen in several other subdirectories under `admin`.

## Directory Structure Observed:

*   `src/app/dashboard/admin/products/`
    *   `new/` (empty)
    *   `[id]/`
        *   `edit/` (empty)

## Findings:

*   **No Listing Page:** No `page.tsx` exists at `src/app/dashboard/admin/products/` for displaying a list of products.
*   **No "Create New" Page:** The `src/app/dashboard/admin/products/new/` directory is empty.
*   **No "View Details" Page:** No `page.tsx` exists directly within `src/app/dashboard/admin/products/[id]/`.
*   **No "Edit" Page:** The `src/app/dashboard/admin/products/[id]/edit/` directory is empty.

## Conclusion based on UI Standards (`docs/UI_STANDARDS.md`):

Due to the absence of page files, a UI review against the standards is not feasible for this section.

Should this feature be developed, it would need to incorporate UI standards such as:

*   **1.1. Consistent Breadcrumbs**
*   **1.2. Page Titles & Descriptions**
*   **1.3. "Back" Buttons**
*   **1.4. "Create New" / Primary List Action Button**
*   **3. Forms & User Input**
*   **4. Data Display**

## Recommendation:

*   If product management is an intended admin feature, the necessary `page.tsx` files for full CRUD functionality need to be created.
*   If this section is not planned for development soon or is deprecated, consider removing the placeholder directories.

Development is required before this section can be meaningfully reviewed against UI standards.
