# UI Review: Dashboard - Edit/View Content Template Page\n\n**Page:** `/dashboard/templates/[id]`\n**File:** `src/app/dashboard/templates/[id]/page.tsx`\n\n**Review Date:** October 25, 2023\n**Reviewer:** AI Assistant\n\nThis review assesses the Edit/View Content Template page structure. The main form content for editing is delegated to the `<TemplateForm />` component (reviewed separately). This page handles data loading for existing templates (both system and user-created) and deletion.\n\n## 0. Global Page Layout & Structure\n\n*   **0.1. Standard Page Regions:**\n    *   Global Header & Main Sidebar: Assumed handled by `layout.tsx`.\n    *   Main Content Area: Root `div` uses `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-6 space-y-8`. Adheres to **0.4 Consistent Padding**.\n*   **0.2. - 0.4.:** Similar to the \"New Template\" page structure; uses flex for header elements. Form structure itself is within `TemplateForm`. Spacing and padding are consistent.\n\n## 1. Navigation & Structure\n\n*   **1.1. Consistent Breadcrumbs:**\n    *   **Presence & Content:** `Breadcrumbs` component: `items={[{ label: \"Dashboard\", href: \"/dashboard\" }, { label: \"Content Templates\", href: \"/dashboard/templates\" }, { label: template?.name || id }]}`. Path is correct; current page (template name) is not linked.\n    *   **Positioning:** Top of the content area.\n    *   **Note:** Placeholder `Breadcrumbs` component (Ref **1.1**).\n*   **1.2. Page Titles & Descriptions:**\n    *   **Page Title (`<h1>`):** `h1` with `{template?.name || \'Edit Template\'}` (dynamically shows template name).\n    *   **Page Description (`<p>`):** \"Modify the fields and settings for this template.\"\n    *   **Positioning:** Below breadcrumbs, left-aligned, grouped with a Back button.\n*   **1.3. \"Back\" Buttons:**\n    *   **Presence:** `ChevronLeft` icon button.\n        ```tsx\n        <Link href=\"/dashboard/templates\" passHref>\n            <Button variant=\"outline\" size=\"icon\" aria-label=\"Back to Templates\">\n                <ChevronLeft className=\"h-4 w-4\" />\n            </Button>\n        </Link>\n        ```\n    *   **Functionality:** Links to `/dashboard/templates`. Uses `Link` component.\n    *   **Positioning:** Top-left, part of page header group. Excellent.\n*   **1.4. \"Create New\" / Primary List Action Button:**\n    *   A \"Delete Template\" button with `Trash2` icon is present in the top-right if user is admin and it\'s not a system template.\n    *   Positioning is acceptable for a page-level action.\n\n## 2. Branding & Contextual Information\n\n*   Not applicable for this page, as templates are generally not brand-specific in their definition.\n\n## 3. Forms & User Input\n\n*   The main form is encapsulated in `<TemplateForm initialData={template} />`. This component is reviewed separately. This page correctly passes `initialData`.\n*   The page handles user authorization (`isGlobalAdmin`) and distinguishes system templates (`isSystemTemplate`).\n*   A comment suggests a potential `isReadOnly` prop for `TemplateForm` for system templates, which is good consideration but not currently implemented in `TemplateForm` based on its props.\n
## 4. Data Display (Lists, Tables, Detail Views)\n\n*   Not applicable for this page itself beyond what `TemplateForm` displays.\n*   **4.3. Empty States / Access Denied / Not Found:**\n    *   If `!isGlobalAdmin`: `ShieldAlert` icon, \"Access Denied\" message, button to go \"Back to Templates\". (Good)\n    *   If `!template && !loading` (template not found after load attempt): `ShieldAlert` (orange), \"Template Not Found\" message, button to go \"Back to Templates\". (Good)\n*   **4.4. Loading Indicators:**\n    *   If `isLoadingUser || loading`: `Loader2` icon with \"Loading template data...\" message. (Good)\n
## 5. Mobile & Responsive Standards\n\n*   Header responsiveness is fine. Form responsiveness depends on `TemplateForm`.\n
## 6. General UI & UX\n\n*   **6.4. Modals & Pop-ups (Dialogs):**\n    *   `AlertDialog` is used for delete confirmation (`showDeleteDialog`).\n        *   **Structure:** Title (\"Are you sure?\"), Description (warning about permanent deletion), Cancel, and Delete buttons.\n        *   **Action Buttons:** Destructive action button is styled appropriately (`bg-destructive`). `isDeleting` state disables buttons.\n        *   Correctly used for destructive action, conditional on `isGlobalAdmin && !isSystemTemplate`.\n*   **6.5. Notifications & Toasts:** `toast` used for session errors, load errors, delete errors/success.\n
## Issues & Recommendations\n\n1.  **High (Deferred):** Review of `<TemplateForm />` is separate but crucial.\n2.  **Minor:** Placeholder `Breadcrumbs` component (Ref **1.1**).\n3.  **Low:** Page title metadata commented out.\n4.  **Consideration (UX/Clarity):** The page effectively serves as an \"Edit Template\" page by rendering `TemplateForm` with initial data. If there was a distinct \"View Template (read-only)\" page, the UI standards for data display (section 4) would be more directly applicable to this page itself (e.g., showing field details in a read-only format). Currently, viewing details means viewing them within the editable `TemplateForm`. If `isSystemTemplate` is true, the form should ideally be read-only. The comment `// isReadOnly={!!isSystemTemplate}` indicates this was considered. Implementing a read-only state for `TemplateForm` when `isSystemTemplate` is true would improve adherence to user expectations for system-defined entities. The delete button is correctly disabled for system templates.\n5.  **Check:** Visually confirm hover/focus states. (Ref: **6.3**)\n\n## Overall Assessment\n\nThe page structure of `src/app/dashboard/templates/[id]/page.tsx` is **well-aligned** with UI standards for a page that loads data and presents an editing interface via a sub-component. It handles loading, error, not found, and access denied states effectively. The delete functionality with confirmation is also well-implemented.\n\nThe main dependency is on `<TemplateForm />` for the actual editing interface. The key consideration for this page is ensuring that system templates are appropriately handled (e.g., presented as read-only or with editing restrictions clearly communicated/enforced through `TemplateForm`).\n
