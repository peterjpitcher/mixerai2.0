# UI Standards Review: `src/app/dashboard/admin/master-claim-brands/`

Date: 2024-07-26

This document outlines the findings from a UI standards review of the `src/app/dashboard/admin/master-claim-brands/` directory structure.

## Overall Assessment

The directory structure for "Master Claim Brands" within the admin section appears to be incomplete or a placeholder. It follows the same empty pattern as other sections observed within the `admin` directory.

## Directory Structure Observed:

*   `src/app/dashboard/admin/master-claim-brands/`
    *   `new/` (empty)
    *   `[id]/`
        *   `edit/` (empty)

## Findings:

*   **No Listing Page:** There is no `page.tsx` file at `src/app/dashboard/admin/master-claim-brands/` for listing master claim brands.
*   **No "Create New" Page:** The `src/app/dashboard/admin/master-claim-brands/new/` directory is empty.
*   **No "View Details" Page:** There is no `page.tsx` directly within `src/app/dashboard/admin/master-claim-brands/[id]/` for viewing details.
*   **No "Edit" Page:** The `src/app/dashboard/admin/master-claim-brands/[id]/edit/` directory is empty.

## Conclusion based on UI Standards (`docs/UI_STANDARDS.md`):

A UI review against the standards document is not possible due to the absence of page files.

If this section were to be implemented, it would need to adhere to standards including:

*   **1.1. Consistent Breadcrumbs**
*   **1.2. Page Titles & Descriptions**
*   **1.3. "Back" Buttons**
*   **1.4. "Create New" / Primary List Action Button**
*   **3. Forms & User Input**
*   **4. Data Display**

## Recommendation:

*   If "Master Claim Brands" is a planned feature, the required `page.tsx` files for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations need to be developed.
*   If not currently planned or deprecated, the placeholder structure should be considered for removal.

This section requires development before a UI standards review can be conducted.
