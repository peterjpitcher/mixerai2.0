# MixerAI 2.0 Deployment Fix Plan

## Current Issues

Based on the Vercel deployment logs, there are several issues preventing successful deployment:

1. **Missing CSS dependencies**:
   - `Cannot find module 'autoprefixer'` error
   - This is critical for Next.js font loading and CSS processing

2. **Missing UI components**:
   - The build is failing with "Can't resolve" errors for component imports like:
     - `@/components/button`
     - `@/components/card`
     - `@/components/input`
     - `@/components/label`

3. **React Server Components issue**:
   - `react-server-dom-webpack` module missing
   - The vercel-build.js script is testing for this dependency but it's not being found

## Root Causes

1. The dependency issues are likely caused by:
   - Dependencies being in devDependencies instead of regular dependencies
   - The build process on Vercel not properly installing or finding dev dependencies
   - Custom build scripts (vercel-build.js) that have dependency checking but aren't fixing the issues

2. The component resolution issues suggest:
   - Path aliases may not be working correctly in the Vercel environment
   - Components might be imported with incorrect casing

## Fix Plan

### Step 1: Update package.json to Move Critical Dependencies

- Move necessary build dependencies from devDependencies to dependencies:
  - autoprefixer
  - postcss
  - tailwindcss
  - tailwindcss-animate
  - @tailwindcss/forms
  - @tailwindcss/typography

### Step 2: Simplify Build Process

- Modify the build script to use standard Next.js build process
- Remove reliance on custom vercel-build.js and clean-cache.js scripts

### Step 3: Add Missing Dependencies

- Add the missing `react-server-dom-webpack` package

### Step 4: Update Component Path Aliases

- Ensure that the component imports in src/app/account/page.tsx use the correct paths
- Fix any casing issues in import statements

## Implementation Plan

1. Update package.json first
2. Create Next.js config file to ensure proper path alias handling
3. Fix import statements in the React components
4. Test build locally before pushing changes

## Success Criteria

- Vercel deployment completes without errors
- CSS styling applies correctly
- Component resolution works across the application
