# Release Notes System

This document describes the release notes system for MixerAI 2.0, including how to update release notes for future versions.

## Overview

MixerAI 2.0 includes a release notes page accessible from the footer of the application. This page displays the history of changes, improvements, and bug fixes across different versions of the application.

## Release Notes Structure

Release notes are organized with the most recent version at the top, followed by older versions in descending order. Each version includes:

- Version number and release date
- A brief description of the release
- Categorized lists of changes:
  - üöÄ New Features: Major new functionality
  - üõ†Ô∏è Improvements: Enhancements to existing features
  - üêõ Bug Fixes: Issues that were resolved

## Updating Release Notes

To add a new version to the release notes:

1. Edit `src/app/release-notes/page.tsx`
2. Add a new `Card` component at the top of the list, following the existing pattern
3. Include the version number, date, and appropriate categories of changes
4. Commit the changes

Example:

```tsx
<Card className="mb-8">
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Version 2.2.0 - August 2023</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Description of the release</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent className="space-y-4">
    <div>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">üöÄ New Features</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Added example new feature</li>
        <!-- Add more features as needed -->
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Add other categories as needed -->
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

## Release Numbering Convention

MixerAI 2.0 follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Significant changes that might not be backward compatible
- **MINOR**: New features or significant improvements that are backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and minor improvements that are backward compatible

For example: v2.1.0 is a minor release with new features, while v2.1.1 would be a patch release with bug fixes.

## Footer Integration

The release notes are accessible via a link in the application footer, which was added to the `RootLayoutWrapper` component. This ensures users can easily access the history of changes from any page in the application.

## Additional Notes

- Keep release notes concise and focused on user-facing changes
- Group related changes under appropriate categories
- Avoid technical jargon when possible
- Consider highlighting particularly important changes

This release notes system helps maintain transparency with users about the evolution of MixerAI 2.0.
