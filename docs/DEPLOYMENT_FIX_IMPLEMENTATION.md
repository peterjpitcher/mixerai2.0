# MixerAI 2.0 Deployment Fix Implementation

## Fixes Implemented

The following fixes have been implemented to address the Vercel deployment issues:

### 1. Package.json Updates

- Simplified the build script from `node clean-cache.js && node vercel-build.js` to the standard `next build` command
- Moved critical CSS dependencies from devDependencies to dependencies:
  - autoprefixer
  - postcss
  - tailwindcss
  - tailwindcss-animate
  - @tailwindcss/forms
  - @tailwindcss/typography
- Added the missing `react-server-dom-webpack` package as a dependency with version `^18.2.0` to match the React version

### 2. Next.js Configuration Updates

- Updated next.config.js to remove experimental features that might interfere with the build
- Added configuration options to improve compatibility with Vercel:
  - skipTrailingSlashRedirect
  - unstable_useDeploymentId set to false
  - transpilePackages (empty array ready for future needs)

### 3. TypeScript Configuration Updates

- Updated tsconfig.json to use "moduleResolution": "bundler" which is more compatible with Next.js 14+
- Confirmed the proper path alias configuration for "@/*" pointing to "src/*"

### 4. Component Import Fixes

- Fixed incorrect import paths in components:
  - Changed `import { useToast } from '@/components/use-toast'` to `import { useToast } from '@/components/toast-provider'` in:
    - src/app/account/page.tsx
    - src/components/content/content-generator-form.tsx

### 5. CSS Configuration

- Ensured the postcss.config.js file is properly set up with the required plugins

## Expected Results

These changes should resolve the deployment issues:

1. CSS dependencies now available in the production build
2. React Server Components properly supported with the added dependency
3. Component paths correctly resolved
4. Build process simplified to use standard Next.js build command

## Future Considerations

1. Consider reviewing all component imports throughout the application
2. Monitor future deployments for any additional issues
3. Consider adding detailed error logging during the build process
4. If needed, create a more comprehensive test suite for the build process
