# Next.js Dependency Resolution Plan

## Problem Analysis

The deployment is failing with the following errors:

```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-server-dom-webpack/server.edge'
Module not found: Can't resolve 'private-next-rsc-mod-ref-proxy'
```

These errors indicate issues with Next.js's React Server Components (RSC) dependencies. The errors originate from Next.js's internal Flight loader and client-side component modules, which are essential for the framework's Server Components functionality.

## Root Cause

Based on the error messages, there are several potential causes:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: The `react-server-dom-webpack` package may be missing or at an incompatible version
2. **Mismatched React Versions**: React, React DOM, and React Server DOM need to be in sync
3. **Package Resolution Issues**: The build process may have issues resolving Next.js's internal module aliases
4. **Stale Build Cache**: Cached artifacts from previous builds may be causing conflicts

## Solution Strategy

We'll implement a multi-step solution to resolve these dependency issues:

1. **Fix Package Dependencies**:
   - Ensure all React-related packages are explicitly defined at compatible versions
   - Add missing dependencies, particularly `react-server-dom-webpack`
   - Pin Node.js version to 18.x for stability

2. **Improve Build Process**:
   - Modify the build script to clear cache before building
   - Ensure proper resolution of Next.js's internal modules
   - Avoid custom webpack configurations that might interfere with Next.js internals

3. **Update Vercel Configuration**:
   - Set appropriate build environment variables to ensure clean builds
   - Configure proper Node.js version

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Update package.json

We'll update the package.json file to:
- Explicitly pin the Node.js version to 18.x
- Add the missing `react-server-dom-webpack` dependency at the correct version
- Ensure all React-related packages are at compatible versions
- Update the build script to include a cache clear step

### 2. Update vercel.json

We'll update vercel.json to:
- Set appropriate build environment variables
- Explicitly configure Node.js version 

### 3. Update build script

We'll update the vercel-build.js script to:
- Clear any cached files that might be causing conflicts
- Ensure proper module resolution for Next.js internals

### 4. Simplify next.config.js

We'll simplify next.config.js to:
- Remove any custom webpack configurations that might interfere with Next.js's module resolution
- Ensure the configuration is compatible with React Server Components

Once these changes are implemented, we should have a clean, working build process that properly resolves all dependencies for Next.js's React Server Components.
