# React Server Components Dependency Resolution Implementation

This document details the implementation of our solution to fix the React Server Components (RSC) dependency issues encountered during deployment to Vercel.

## Files Modified

1. **package.json**
   - Pinned Node.js to version 18.x for stability
   - Added missing `react-server-dom-webpack` dependency at version 18.3.1
   - Pinned React and React DOM to exact versions (18.3.1) to ensure compatibility
   - Removed caret (^) from Next.js version to prevent minor version shifts
   - Updated build script to include cache cleaning step

2. **clean-cache.js (New)**
   - Created script to clean stale cache directories
   - Removes `.next`, `.vercel/output`, and `node_modules/.cache`
   - Creates `.npmrc` with proper peer dependency settings
   - Cross-platform support for Windows and Unix-based systems

3. **vercel.json**
   - Added environment variable to disable build cache: `VERCEL_FORCE_NO_BUILD_CACHE`
   - Disabled telemetry with `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED`
   - Set installation command to `npm install --no-save` for clean installs
   - Added GitHub integration settings

4. **vercel-build.js**
   - Added environment verification step to check for RSC dependencies
   - Implements runtime dependency checking and auto-repair
   - Added memory allocation settings to prevent OOM errors
   - Updated framework version reference

5. **next.config.js**
   - Simplified configuration by removing potentially conflicting settings
   - Removed custom experimental features that might interfere with RSC
   - Eliminated custom webpack configurations

6. **.npmrc (New)**
   - Created with settings to handle peer dependencies properly
   - Set `legacy-peer-deps=true` to avoid dependency conflicts
   - Set `strict-peer-dependencies=false` for more flexible resolution
   - Added `node-linker=hoisted` for proper module resolution

## How The Solution Works

### 1. Dependency Management

The core issue was missing or incompatible React Server Components dependencies. Our solution:

- Explicitly includes `react-server-dom-webpack` at version 18.3.1
- Ensures all React packages (`react`, `react-dom`, `react-server-dom-webpack`) are at the same exact version
- Uses `.npmrc` settings to prevent peer dependency conflicts

### 2. Build Process Improvements

To ensure clean builds without stale artifacts:

- The `clean-cache.js` script removes any cached files that might cause conflicts
- Environment variables in `vercel.json` enforce clean builds on Vercel
- The build script includes environment verification to detect and fix dependency issues

### 3. Runtime Verification

The `vercel-build.js` script now:

- Tests for the presence of required modules before building
- Automatically attempts to fix missing or broken dependencies
- Increases Node.js memory allocation to handle larger builds

### 4. Configuration Simplification

We simplified the Next.js configuration to:

- Remove any custom webpack configuration that might interfere with module resolution
- Eliminate experimental features that might conflict with React Server Components
- Focus on a minimal, stable configuration

## Expected Results

With these changes, the build process should:

1. Start with a clean environment free of stale artifacts
2. Properly resolve all React Server Components dependencies
3. Generate the correct serverless function files for Vercel
4. Deploy successfully without the "Module not found" errors

## Monitoring and Maintenance

After deployment:

1. Check Vercel deployment logs for any warnings or errors
2. Verify that React Server Components are working correctly
3. Monitor performance for any regressions

## Future Considerations

As Next.js and React evolve, keep in mind:

1. React Server Components are still evolving and may change in future releases
2. Keep React, React DOM, and React Server DOM Webpack versions in sync
3. When upgrading Next.js, ensure all related packages are compatible

This implementation should resolve the current deployment issues and provide a more stable foundation for future development.
