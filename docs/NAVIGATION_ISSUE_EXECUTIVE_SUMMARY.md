# Navigation Issue - Executive Summary

## Issue Overview

We've identified a critical issue with the navigation structure in the MixerAI 2.0 application. Despite properly implementing a new content type submenu (Articles, Owned PDP, Retailer PDP) in the side navigation component, users are not seeing these changes in the UI.

## Root Cause

The application has a complex nested layout structure with competing navigation systems:

1. **Route Inconsistency**: Content is accessible via both `/content/*` and `/dashboard/content/*` routes
2. **Redirection Issues**: The dashboard page is redirecting to the root path (`/`)
3. **Multiple Navigation Components**: Both `RootLayoutWrapper` and `DashboardLayout` contain different navigation systems

## Proposed Solution

We recommend standardizing on the dashboard route pattern for all authenticated content:

1. **Fix Dashboard Home**: Replace the redirect in `dashboard/page.tsx` with an actual dashboard UI
2. **Redirect Non-Dashboard Routes**: Add redirects from `/content/*` to `/dashboard/content/*`
3. **Consistent Route Patterns**: Update all internal links to use `/dashboard/...` prefixes

1. [Full Issue Analysis](./NAVIGATION_STRUCTURE_ISSUE.md) - Comprehensive analysis of the issue
2. [Implementation Plan](./NAVIGATION_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION.md) - Step-by-step code changes

## Benefits

This approach will:
- Provide a consistent navigation experience across the application
- Ensure the content type submenu is visible to users
- Maintain authentication boundaries through the dashboard layout
- Eliminate route confusion

## Next Steps

1. Review the implementation plan with your team
2. Approve the proposed changes
3. Implement the solution on the `enhance-content-section` branch
4. Test the navigation structure thoroughly before merging
