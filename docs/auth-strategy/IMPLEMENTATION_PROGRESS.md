# Authentication Strategy Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2) - IN PROGRESS

We have begun implementing the revised authentication strategy as outlined in the [AUTH_STRATEGY_PLAN_REVISED.md](./AUTH_STRATEGY_PLAN_REVISED.md). Below is our progress so far:

### Completed Tasks:

1. ✅ **Next.js Middleware for Route Protection**
   - Created a new middleware implementation in `src/middleware.ts`
   - Added authentication checks for protected routes
   - Configured automatic redirects to login for dashboard routes
   - Set up 401 responses for API routes
   - Added path matcher configuration to exclude public routes

2. ✅ **API Route Authentication Wrapper**
   - Implemented `withAuth` and `withAuthAndMonitoring` HOCs in `src/lib/auth/api-auth.ts`
   - Set up standardized error responses
   - Added automatic user context passing to handlers
   - Implemented performance monitoring for API requests

3. ✅ **Updated Supabase Client Initialization**
   - Updated client-side Supabase initialization in `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` to use `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr`
   - Added safety check to prevent service role key use in client context
   - Updated error handling for client initialization

4. ✅ **API Route Migration Started**
   - Updated the Brands API route (`src/app/api/brands/route.ts`) to use the new `withAuth` wrapper
   - Added user context to brand creation (setting `created_by` field)
   - Standardized request/response handling

5. ✅ **API Client for Modern Authentication**
   - Created a new `src/lib/api-client.ts` with fetch utilities
   - Implemented cookie-based authentication with Supabase
   - Added automatic session refresh on 401 responses
   - Created typed helper methods for common API operations

6. ✅ **Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies Defined**
   - Created comprehensive RLS policy documentation in `docs/auth-strategy/RLS_POLICIES.md`
   - Developed SQL migration script in `migrations/rls_policies.sql`
   - Created deployment script in `scripts/apply-rls-policies.sh`
   - Implemented policies for brands, content, profiles, and workflows tables
   - Added role-based access control patterns

7. ✅ **Environment Variable Security Audit**
   - Created environment variable security guidelines in `docs/auth-strategy/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SECURITY.md`
   - Classified all variables by sensitivity
   - Defined secure access patterns
   - Created remediation steps for security incidents
   - Implemented server context checks in Supabase admin client

### Pending Tasks:

1. ⏳ **Remove localStorage/sessionStorage Token Storage**
   - Identify and refactor all client components using localStorage
   - Update any custom token retrieval code

2. ⏳ **Update Session Provider**
   - Refactor any custom session providers to use Supabase session
   - Ensure consistent auth state across the application

3. ⏳ **Execute RLS Policy Migration**
   - Run the RLS migration script against the database
   - Test policies with different user roles
   - Verify proper data isolation

## Next Steps:

1. Continue migrating API routes to use the `withAuth` wrapper
2. Remove any remaining localStorage/sessionStorage token storage
3. Apply the RLS policies to the database
4. Begin planning for Phase 2 (Client Integration)

## Current Challenges:

- Ensuring backward compatibility during the transition
- Identifying all locations where custom token storage/retrieval is used
- Testing authentication flows thoroughly

## Expected Completion:

Phase 1 should be completed by [TARGET_DATE]. After Phase 1 completion, we will proceed with Phase 2 (Client Integration).
