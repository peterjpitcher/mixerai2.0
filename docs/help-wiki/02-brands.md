# Managing Brands in MixerAI

This section provides a detailed guide to understanding and effectively managing your brands within MixerAI. Properly defining your brands is crucial for generating AI content that is on-target, consistent, and resonates with your audience. You can directly access the [Brands section in the app here](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/brands).

## What are Brands in MixerAI?

In MixerAI, a 'Brand' is a comprehensive profile that encapsulates a distinct brand identity. It's more than just a name; it includes all the key characteristics that define how a brand communicates. This information is used by MixerAI's AI engine to tailor content generation.

Key elements of a Brand profile typically include:

*   **Brand Name:** The official name of the brand.
*   **Website URL:** The primary website for the brand.
*   **Country & Language:** Helps tailor content to specific regions and languages.
*   **Brand Identity:** A summary of what the brand stands for, its mission, values, and unique selling propositions.
    *   *Example:* For an eco-friendly brand: "We provide sustainable and ethically sourced home goods for environmentally conscious consumers. Our mission is to make green living accessible and stylish."
*   **Tone of Voice:** Describes the personality and style of the brand's communication.
    *   *Example:* "Friendly, informative, and slightly witty. Avoid overly technical jargon. Aim for an inspiring and empowering tone."
*   **Guardrails/Key Messages:** Specific phrases to include or avoid, core messages to emphasize, or topics that are off-limits.
    *   *Example:* "Always mention our commitment to 100% recyclable packaging. Avoid comparisons with competitor X."
*   **Target Audience:** A description of the ideal customer or audience segment.
    *   *Example:* "Millennials and Gen Z, environmentally aware, active on social media, interested in sustainable living and DIY projects."

## How to Manage Brands:

1.  **Navigate to the Brands Section:** From the main dashboard menu (usually on the left), click on "Brands" or use this [direct link to Brands](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/brands).

2.  **Viewing Your Brands:** You'll see a list or a grid of all existing brands you have access to. This overview might show key details like the brand name and when it was last updated.

3.  **Adding a New Brand:**
    *   Look for a button like "+ New Brand," "Create Brand," or "Add Brand" (usually found on the [main Brands page](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/brands) or via a [direct link for new brands](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/brands/new)).
    *   You'll be presented with a form to fill in all the brand elements listed above (Name, Website, Identity, Tone, etc.).
    *   **Tip:** Be as detailed and specific as possible in each field. The more information the AI has, the better it can match your brand's style.
    *   Once you've filled in all the details, click "Save" or "Create Brand."

4.  **Editing an Existing Brand:**
    *   From the list of brands on the [Brands page](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/brands), click on the name of the brand you wish to edit (or its edit icon).
    *   This will take you to the brand's detail/edit page (e.g., `https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/brands/[ID]/edit`).
    *   Make your desired changes to any of the brand elements.
    *   **Remember to save your changes!**

5.  **Deleting/Archiving a Brand (If Applicable):**
    *   If you no longer need a brand, there might be an option to delete or archive it from its edit page or the main brand list.
    *   Be cautious when deleting brands, especially if content has been created under them (see [Creating & Managing Content](./?article=03-content)).

## Tips for Effective Brand Management:

*   **Be Specific:** Vague descriptions lead to generic AI content. The more detailed your Brand Identity, Tone of Voice, and Guardrails, the better the AI (detailed in [Using AI Tools](./?article=09-tools)) can assist you.
*   **Use Examples:** If possible, provide short examples of good and bad communication styles for your brand within the Tone of Voice or Guardrails sections.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Ensure all information is consistent across the brand profile.
*   **Regularly Review and Update:** Brands evolve. Make it a practice to review your brand profiles in MixerAI periodically (e.g., quarterly or annually) and update them if there are any changes to your brand strategy, messaging, or target audience.
*   **Collaborate with Your Team:** If multiple team members work on a brand, ensure everyone understands the defined brand profile in MixerAI.
