# Managing Your Account in MixerAI

This section explains how to manage your personal account settings within MixerAI. Keeping your account information up to date and managing your preferences helps ensure a smooth and secure experience. You can typically [access your account settings here](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/account).

## Accessing Your Account Settings

1.  **Locate Your Profile:** Look for your name, initials, or profile picture, which is usually displayed in the top-right corner of the MixerAI dashboard after you log in.
2.  **Open the Menu:** Click on your name/icon. This will typically open a dropdown menu.
3.  **Select Account Options:** In this menu, look for links such as "Account," "My Profile," "Settings," or "Account Settings." Clicking one of these will take you to your personal account management page (usually `https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/account`).

## What You Can Typically Manage:

While specific options can vary, common account settings include:

*   **Profile Information:**
    *   **Name:** Update your first and last name.
    *   **Job Title/Role (Informational):** Sometimes you can specify your job title for display purposes.
    *   **Profile Picture:** Upload or change your avatar.
    *   **Contact Information (Informational):** May display your email address (often not editable if used for login) or allow you to add a secondary contact.

*   **Security Settings:**
    *   **Change Password:** This is a crucial security feature. You'll typically need to enter your current password and then your new password twice.
        *   *Tip:* Use a strong, unique password that combines uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid easily guessable information.
    *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA):** If MixerAI supports it, this is where you would enable or manage 2FA for an extra layer of security. This might involve linking an authenticator app or using SMS codes.
    *   **Login Activity:** Some systems show a history of recent logins, including dates, times, and locations, which can help you spot suspicious activity.

*   **Email Notification Preferences:**
    *   Control which types of emails you receive from MixerAI.
    *   *Examples:* Notifications for [new task assignments](./?article=06-my-tasks), updates on [content](./?article=03-content) you're involved with in [workflows](./?article=05-workflows), system announcements, etc.
    *   You can usually toggle these preferences on or off.

*   **Interface Preferences (If Available):**
    *   **Theme:** Choose between a light or dark mode for the user interface.
    *   **Language:** Select your preferred language for the MixerAI interface if multiple languages are supported.
    *   **Time Zone:** Ensure the time zone is set correctly for accurate display of dates and times.

*   **API Keys or Integrations (Advanced):**
    *   If you use MixerAI with other tools via API, this section might be where you manage your API keys.

## Security Best Practices for Your Account:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Use a complex and unique password for MixerAI. Don't reuse passwords from other sites.
*   **Change Passwords Regularly:** Consider changing your password periodically (e.g., every 3-6 months) or if you suspect your account might be compromised.
*   **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** If available, always enable 2FA. It significantly increases your account security.
*   **Log Out Securely:** When you're finished using MixerAI, especially on shared or public computers, make sure to log out properly.
*   **Be Wary of Phishing:** Be cautious of emails or messages asking for your MixerAI login details. Always access MixerAI directly through its known URL: `https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/`.
*   **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you notice any unusual activity on your account, report it to your administrator or Peter Pitcher immediately.
