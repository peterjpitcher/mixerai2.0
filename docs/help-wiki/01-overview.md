# MixerAI Dashboard Overview

Welcome to your MixerAI dashboard! This is your central hub for managing all your content creation activities, from brainstorming ideas to finalising your marketing materials. Think of it as your command centre for everything content-related.

## Navigating Your Dashboard

When you first log in, you'll land on the main dashboard page. Here, you'll typically find:

*   **A Quick Snapshot:** This might include recent activity, content pieces that need your attention, or a summary of ongoing projects.
*   **Main Navigation Menu:** Usually on the left side of the screen or across the top, this menu is your gateway to all of MixerAI's features. Common menu items are listed below.
*   **User Profile/Account Access:** Look for your name or a profile icon (often in the top-right corner) to access your personal [account settings](./?article=08-account) or to log out.

## Key Sections Explained

Here's a bit more detail on what you can do in each key section accessible from your main navigation:

*   **Dashboard:** This is your homepage within MixerAI, accessible via the [main Dashboard link](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard). It gives you a bird's-eye view of your current work, pending tasks, and recent notifications.
    *   *Example:* You might see "3 Pieces of Content Awaiting Your Review" or "Recently Created Brands."

*   **Brands:** This is where you define and manage the different brand identities you work with. Each brand can have its own unique voice, style, target audience, and specific guidelines that MixerAI will use to help generate tailored content. Learn more in the [Managing Brands](./?article=02-brands) guide or [go to the Brands section](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/brands).
    *   *Example:* If you manage marketing for "EcoFriendly Home Goods" and "Tech Gadgets Inc.", you'd create two separate brands here, each with distinct instructions on tone (e.g., "warm and earthy" vs. "innovative and sleek").

*   **Content:** The heart of your work in MixerAI. Here you can create new marketing content (like blog posts, social media updates, or product descriptions), edit existing pieces, and track their progress through your creation and approval cycle. See the [Creating & Managing Content](./?article=03-content) guide for details or [visit the Content section](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/content).
    *   *Example:* You could start a new blog post for "EcoFriendly Home Goods" about "Sustainable Living Tips."

*   **Templates:** Save time and maintain consistency by using or creating content templates. These are pre-set structures for common content types. Read more about [Using Content Templates](./?article=04-templates) or [explore Templates in the app](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/templates).
    *   *Example:* You could have a "Weekly Newsletter Template" that includes sections for an introduction, main story, product highlight, and call to action.

*   **Workflows:** Define the step-by-step approval processes your content needs to follow. This ensures quality and that all necessary reviews happen before content goes live. Detailed information is in the [Understanding & Managing Workflows](./?article=05-workflows) article. You can [manage Workflows here](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/workflows).
    *   *Example:* A typical workflow might be: 1. Draft -> 2. Editorial Review -> 3. Legal Check -> 4. Final Approval.

*   **My Tasks:** Your personal to-do list. This section shows all content pieces or workflow steps that are specifically assigned to you and require your action (e.g., review, edit, approve). Check out the [Managing Your Tasks](./?article=06-my-tasks) guide or [view your tasks now](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/my-tasks).
    *   *Example:* If a colleague finishes drafting a blog post and it's your turn to review it, it will appear in "My Tasks."

*   **Users (Admin):** If you have administrator privileges, this section allows you to manage user accounts, invite new team members, and set their permission levels. More info can be found in [User Management (Admin)](./?article=07-users). [Manage Users here](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/users) (admin access required).

*   **Account:** Manage your personal MixerAI profile, such as updating your name, changing your password, or adjusting notification preferences. See the [Managing Your Account](./?article=08-account) page for details or [go to your Account settings](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/account).

*   **Tools:** Access a suite of helpful AI-powered utilities designed to assist with various aspects of content creation, like generating titles, suggesting keywords, or creating image descriptions. Learn about [Using AI Tools](./?article=09-tools) or [access the Tools section](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/tools).
