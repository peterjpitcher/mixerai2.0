# Using Content Templates in MixerAI

Content Templates in MixerAI are powerful tools for streamlining your [content creation process](./?article=03-content), ensuring brand consistency, and guiding AI text generation effectively. This guide explains what they are, how to use them, and how to manage them. You can usually manage templates via the [Templates section](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/templates) in the app.

## What are Content Templates?

Think of Content Templates as pre-defined blueprints or starting points for specific types of content. They are more than just a blank page; they can include:

*   **Pre-defined Structure:** Headings, subheadings, and sections tailored to the content type.
    *   *Example:* A "Product Review Blog Post" template might have sections for Introduction, Product Features, Pros, Cons, and Conclusion.
*   **Standardised Text:** Boilerplate text that is common to that content type, like disclaimers or standard introductions/outros.
*   **AI Prompts & Instructions:** Specific guidance embedded within the template to help the AI (see [Using AI Tools](./?article=09-tools)) generate relevant and structured text for each section.
    *   *Example:* In a "How-To Article" template, a section might have an AI prompt like: "Write 3-5 clear, actionable steps for [Topic of the article]. Each step should start with an action verb."
*   **Formatting Guidelines:** Notes on preferred formatting or style.
*   **Placeholders:** Reminders for information that needs to be filled in, like `[Insert Product Name Here]` or `[Link to relevant case study]`.

Common examples of content types that benefit from templates:

*   Blog Posts (e.g., listicles, how-to guides, reviews)
*   Social Media Updates (e.g., tweet threads, Instagram caption structures)
*   Email Newsletters
*   Product Descriptions
*   Case Studies
*   Press Releases

## How to Use Content Templates:

1.  **When Creating New Content:**
    *   Typically, when you start [creating new content](./?article=03-content) (via "Content" > "+ New Content" or [direct link](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/content/new)), after selecting a [Brand](./?article=02-brands), you'll be prompted to select a **Content Type** or directly choose from a list of available **Templates**.
    *   Select the template that best matches the content you intend to create.
    *   The content editor will then load with the template's structure, pre-filled text, and any embedded AI prompts.

2.  **Working with a Template in the Editor:**
    *   **Fill in the Blanks:** Complete any placeholder information specific to your current piece.
    *   **Utilise AI Prompts:** If the template includes AI prompts within sections, use the AI generation tools, and the AI will consider these specific instructions.
    *   **Customise as Needed:** While templates provide a great starting point, you can always modify the structure or content to fit your specific needs for that individual piece.

## Managing Templates (Usually for Admins or Senior Roles):

If you have the necessary permissions, you might be able to manage the template library:

1.  **Accessing the Template Library:** There might be a dedicated "Templates" or "Content Templates" section in the main dashboard navigation, or use the [direct link to Templates](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/templates).

2.  **Viewing Existing Templates:** Browse the list of available templates. You might see details like the template name, description, and when it was last updated.

3.  **Creating a New Template:**
    *   Look for a "+ New Template" or "Create Template" button (e.g., on the [Templates page](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/templates) or via a [direct new template link like](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/templates/new)).
    *   You'll likely need to provide:
        *   **Template Name:** A clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Weekly Product Update Email").
        *   **Description:** A brief explanation of what the template is for.
        *   **Content Body/Structure:** Using a rich text editor, you will define the sections, headings, standard text, AI prompts (often using special formatting like `[AI_PROMPT: Write a catchy opening line about our latest product feature]`), and placeholders.
    *   Save the new template to make it available for your team.

4.  **Editing an Existing Template:**
    *   Select a template from the library to open it for editing (e.g., `https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/templates/[ID]/edit`).
    *   Modify its name, description, or content body as needed.
    *   Save your changes. **Note:** Editing a template might affect future content created from it, but usually won't change content already created using an older version of the template.

5.  **Duplicating a Template:** A useful feature to create a new template based on an existing one.

6.  **Deleting/Archiving a Template:** Remove templates that are no longer needed.

## Benefits of Using Templates:

*   **Consistency:** Ensures all content of a particular type adheres to [brand guidelines](./?article=02-brands) and a standard format.
*   **Efficiency:** Drastically speeds up the content creation process by providing a ready-made structure and starting points.
*   **Quality Control:** Helps maintain a consistent level of quality and completeness.
*   **Better AI Guidance:** Well-crafted AI prompts within templates lead to more relevant and useful AI-generated text from the [AI Tools](./?article=09-tools).
*   **Easier Onboarding:** New team members can get up to speed faster by using established templates.
