# Providing Feedback on MixerAI

Your feedback is incredibly valuable to us! It helps us understand what's working well, what could be improved, and what new features would make MixerAI even better for you. This page guides you on how to provide effective feedback. The main [Feedback section can be found here](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/feedback) (if available) or look for feedback options within the app.

## Why Your Feedback Matters

*   **Improves User Experience:** Helps us identify pain points and make MixerAI more intuitive and enjoyable to use.
*   **Drives Development:** Your suggestions for new features and enhancements directly influence our development roadmap.
*   **Fixes Bugs:** Reporting issues helps us find and fix bugs faster, leading to a more stable platform for everyone.

## How to Provide Feedback

MixerAI might offer several ways to submit feedback:

*   **Dedicated Feedback Section:** There may be a specific "Feedback" link in the main navigation (e.g., [https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/feedback](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/feedback)) where you can submit detailed comments, bug reports, or feature requests.
*   **In-App Feedback Widgets:** Look for floating feedback buttons (often a speech bubble, question mark, or "Feedback" tab) on various pages. These are great for quick comments related to what you're currently viewing.
*   **Surveys:** Occasionally, we might send out surveys to gather opinions on specific topics.

**When submitting feedback, please try to be as specific and clear as possible:**

1.  **Summarise Your Feedback:** A clear title or a brief summary helps us categorise and understand your input quickly.
    *   *Good Example:* "Bug: Unable to save changes to Brand X profile after editing Tone of Voice."
    *   *Less Helpful:* "It's broken."

2.  **Describe What You Were Doing:** Provide context. What specific page were you on? What action were you trying to perform?
    *   *Example:* "I was on the [Brand edit page for Brand X](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/brands/ID/edit) and attempting to update the 'Tone of Voice' field."

3.  **Explain What Happened (The Issue):** Clearly describe the problem you encountered or the idea you have.
    *   *Example (for a bug):* "After typing my new tone of voice and clicking 'Save Changes,' I received an error message saying 'Update Failed,' and the changes were not saved. The old text remained."
    *   *Example (for a feature request):* "It would be great if we could duplicate existing [Content Templates](./?article=04-templates) to make it easier to create variations."

4.  **What Did You Expect to Happen?** This is especially important for bug reports. It helps us understand if the system is not behaving as intended.
    *   *Example:* "I expected the new Tone of Voice text to be saved and reflected on the brand's profile."

5.  **Steps to Reproduce (for Bugs):** If you're reporting a bug, list the steps someone else could follow to experience the same issue. This is extremely helpful for our developers.
    *   *Example:*
        1.  Go to [Brands section](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/brands).
        2.  Click "Edit" on Brand X.
        3.  Modify the "Tone of Voice" field.
        4.  Click "Save Changes."
        5.  Observe error message.

6.  **Include Screenshots or Videos (If Possible and Relevant):** A picture (or short video) is often worth a thousand words, especially for visual bugs or complex issues. Most operating systems have built-in tools for taking screenshots.

7.  **Specify Your Environment (If Relevant):** Sometimes, issues are specific to a certain web browser or operating system. If you think it might be relevant, mention it (e.g., "Using Chrome on Windows 11").

## Types of Feedback We Welcome:

*   **Bug Reports:** If something isn't working correctly, is broken, or produces an error.
*   **Feature Requests:** Ideas for new functionalities or enhancements to existing ones that would improve your workflow or experience.
*   **Usability Issues:** If you find something confusing, difficult to use, or counter-intuitive.
*   **General Comments & Suggestions:** Your overall thoughts on MixerAI, what you like, or what could be better.
*   **Praise!** If you love a feature or had a great experience, we'd love to hear that too!
