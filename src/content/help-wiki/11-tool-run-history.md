# Understanding Your Tool Run History

MixerAI keeps a record of the tasks you perform with our AI-powered tools: the Alt Text Generator, Metadata Generator, and Content Trans-creator. This feature, called "Tool Run History," allows you to look back at your previous activities, review the inputs you provided, see the outputs generated by the AI, and check the status of each run.

## What is Tool Run History?

Every time you use one of the supported AI tools, a history record is created. This record includes:

*   **Tool Name:** Which tool was used.
*   **Date & Time:** When the tool was run.
*   **Status:** Whether the run was a 'success' or a 'failure'.
*   **Inputs:** The data you provided to the tool (e.g., image URLs, web page URLs, content for trans-creation).
*   **Outputs:** The results generated by the tool (e.g., alt text, metadata, trans-created content). If a run failed, this might contain error details.
*   **Error Message:** If a run failed, a specific message explaining the issue.
*   **Associated Brand:** For tools like the Content Trans-creator, the brand that was targeted for the run.

## Accessing Your Tool Run History

There are two main ways to access your history:

### 1. From Each Tool Page

When you visit the page for the Alt Text Generator, Metadata Generator, or Content Trans-creator, you'll find a **"Run History"** section.

*   This section displays a list of your most recent runs for that specific tool.
*   For each run, you'll see the date it was performed and its status (e.g., Success, Failure).
*   Each item in this list has a **"View Details"** button.

### 2. Viewing Detailed History

Clicking the "View Details" button from the history list on a tool page will take you to a dedicated **Tool Run Details** page. This page shows all the information captured for that specific run, including:

*   A summary of the run (tool name, date, status).
*   Your User ID and the unique ID of the run.
*   The Brand ID, if applicable.
*   The exact **Inputs** you provided (you can expand this section to see the full details).
*   The **Outputs** generated by the tool (also expandable).
*   If the run failed, a clear **Error Details** section will explain what went wrong.

## Why Use Tool Run History?

*   **Track Your Work:** Easily see what tasks you've performed and when.
*   **Review Results:** Look back at previously generated content or metadata.
*   **Troubleshoot Issues:** If a tool run fails, the history provides error messages that can help understand the problem.
*   **Verify Inputs:** Double-check the exact inputs you used for a particular run.

We hope the Tool Run History feature helps you manage your AI-powered content creation more effectively!
