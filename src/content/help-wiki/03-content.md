# Creating & Managing Content in MixerAI

This guide walks you through the process of creating, editing, and managing your marketing content within MixerAI. This section is where your [Brand profiles](./?article=02-brands) and [AI tools](./?article=09-tools) come together to produce engaging materials. Access the main [Content section here](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/content).

## What is "Content" in MixerAI?

In MixerAI, 'Content' refers to any specific piece of marketing material you develop. This is a broad term that can include:

*   Blog posts and articles
*   Social media updates (Tweets, Facebook posts, LinkedIn articles, etc.)
*   Product descriptions for e-commerce sites
*   Email newsletter copy
*   Website page copy (About Us, Services, etc.)
*   Advertising copy
*   And much more!

Each piece of content is typically associated with a specific **Brand** (to define its style and voice - see [Managing Brands](./?article=02-brands)) and a **Content Type** (to define its structure and purpose, often linked to a **Template** - see [Using Content Templates](./?article=04-templates)).

## How to Work with Content:

1.  **Navigate to the Content Section:** From the main dashboard menu, select "Content" or use this [direct link to Content](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/content). This will usually display a list or table of all existing content pieces, often with filters for status, brand, or date.

2.  **Creating New Content:**
    *   Look for a prominent button such as "+ New Content," "Create Content," or similar on the [Content page](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/content) or via the [direct link to create new content](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/content/new).
    *   You will likely be asked to select:
        *   **Brand:** Choose the brand this content is for. This tells MixerAI which brand identity, tone, and guardrails to use (defined in [Managing Brands](./?article=02-brands)).
        *   **Content Type / Template:** Select the type of content you want to create (e.g., "Blog Post," "Tweet Series"). This may automatically apply a predefined template (see [Using Content Templates](./?article=04-templates)).
    *   Click "Create" or "Next" to proceed to the content editor.

3.  **The Content Editor:** This is where you'll spend most of your time crafting your message. Key features often include:
    *   **Title Field:** For your content's main title.
    *   **Body Editor:** A rich text editor for the main content. You can type directly, paste text, or use AI generation tools.
    *   **AI Tools Integration:** Buttons or options to leverage features described in [Using AI Tools](./?article=09-tools):
        *   "Generate Title Ideas"
        *   "Write an Introduction"
        *   "Expand on this Point"
        *   "Rephrase this Paragraph"
        *   "Check Grammar & Tone"
    *   **Metadata Fields:** For SEO elements like Meta Title, Meta Description, keywords, etc. These might also have AI assistance.
    *   **Saving:** Regularly save your work! Look for "Save Draft" or an autosave feature.

4.  **Viewing and Filtering Existing Content:**
    *   The main [Content page](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/content) will list all your content. You can usually sort by title, date, status, etc.
    *   Use filters to narrow down the list, for example, to see only "Draft" content for a specific "Brand."

5.  **Editing Existing Content:**
    *   From the content list, click on the title of the piece you want to edit (e.g., `https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/content/[ID]/edit`).
    *   This will open it in the content editor, allowing you to make changes.

6.  **Understanding Content Status:** Content typically moves through several statuses in its lifecycle. Common statuses include:
    *   **Draft:** Still being worked on, not yet submitted for review.
    *   **Pending Review:** Submitted and awaiting review by a team member as per the defined workflow (see [Understanding & Managing Workflows](./?article=05-workflows)).
    *   **Needs Revision:** A reviewer has requested changes.
    *   **Approved:** All reviews are complete, and the content is approved.
    *   **Scheduled:** Approved and scheduled for future publishing.
    *   **Published:** The content is live.
    *   **Rejected:** The content was not approved and will not be used.

7.  **Working with AI Generation Tools:**
    *   **Be Clear with Prompts:** When asking the AI to generate text, provide specific instructions. Instead of "Write a blog post," try "Write a 500-word blog post about the benefits of organic cotton, targeting environmentally conscious shoppers, in a friendly and informative tone." Reference the [Brand's](./?article=02-brands) tone of voice.
    *   **Iterate:** Don't expect the first AI output to be perfect. Use it as a starting point. You can ask the AI to regenerate, rephrase, shorten, or expand on its suggestions.
    *   **Review and Edit:** Always review AI-generated text for accuracy, relevance, tone, and originality. Make it your own!

## Content Approval Workflows

Many content pieces will be linked to an **Approval Workflow**. This means that after you finish your draft, it might automatically be sent to one or more colleagues for review and approval before it can be considered final. You can usually track the workflow status on the content's detail page. See the [Understanding & Managing Workflows](./?article=05-workflows) help article for more information.

## Tips for Great Content Creation in MixerAI:

*   **Define Your Brands Thoroughly:** The better your [Brand profiles](./?article=02-brands) are set up, the more helpful the AI will be.
*   **Utilise Templates:** For recurring content types, [Templates](./?article=04-templates) are a huge time-saver.
*   **Experiment with AI Prompts:** Learn what kinds of instructions give you the best results from the [AI tools](./?article=09-tools).
*   **Don't Forget the Human Touch:** AI is a powerful assistant, but your expertise and review are essential for high-quality, authentic content.
