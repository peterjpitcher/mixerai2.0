# Managing Your Tasks in MixerAI

The "My Tasks" section in MixerAI is your personalised action centre. It aggregates all [content pieces](./?article=03-content) and [workflow steps](./?article=05-workflows) that specifically require your input, helping you stay organised and on top of your responsibilities. You can [access your tasks here](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/my-tasks).

## What is "My Tasks"?

Think of "My Tasks" as your dynamic to-do list within the MixerAI platform. Whenever a piece of [content](./?article=03-content) reaches a [workflow step](./?article=05-workflows) where you are an assigned reviewer or editor, or if a specific action is delegated to you, it will appear here. This ensures you don't miss important items that are pending your action.

Key functions of the "My Tasks" section:
*   **Centralised View:** See all items needing your attention in one place.
*   **Action-Oriented:** Clearly indicates what action is expected from you.
*   **Workflow Integration:** Directly linked to the [content](./?article=03-content) and its current position in the approval [workflow](./?article=05-workflows).

## How to Use "My Tasks" Effectively:

1.  **Accessing Your Tasks:**
    *   Look for a "My Tasks," "Tasks," or sometimes an icon like a checkmark or list in the main dashboard navigation menu. Or, use the [direct link to My Tasks](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/my-tasks).
    *   Clicking this will take you to your tasks list.

2.  **Understanding the Task List:** Your task list will typically display several pieces of information for each item:
    *   **Content Title:** The name of the blog post, social media update, etc., that requires your attention. Often, this is a clickable link that takes you directly to the content item (e.g., `https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/content/[ID]/edit`).
    *   **Assigned Action/Step:** What you need to do (e.g., "Review Draft," "Approve Legal Compliance," "Edit for SEO"). This relates to a step in a [Workflow](./?article=05-workflows).
    *   **Brand:** The [brand](./?article=02-brands) associated with the content.
    *   **Due Date (if applicable):** Some tasks might have a deadline.
    *   **Date Assigned:** When the task appeared on your list.
    *   **Priority (if applicable):** Some systems might allow tasks to be prioritised.

3.  **Actioning a Task:**
    *   **Click on the Task:** Select a task from your list. This will usually navigate you directly to the relevant content item within the editor or a specific review interface.
    *   **Perform the Required Action:** Review the content, make edits if necessary, and then use the workflow action buttons (e.g., "Approve," "Request Revisions," "Submit for Next Step").
    *   *Example:* If your task is "Review Editorial Draft," you would read the content, potentially make edits or leave comments, and then click an "Approve" button to move it to the next [workflow step](./?article=05-workflows), or a "Request Revisions" button to send it back to the author with your feedback.

4.  **Task Completion and Removal:**
    *   Once you successfully complete the required action (e.g., approve a review, submit your edits), the task will typically be automatically removed from your "My Tasks" list or marked as complete.
    *   This keeps your list clean and focused on pending items.

## Staying Organised with "My Tasks":

*   **Check Regularly:** Make it a habit to check your ["My Tasks" section](https://mixerai.orangejelly.co.uk/dashboard/my-tasks) at least once a day, or more frequently if you handle a high volume of content.
*   **Prioritise:** If your list is long, pay attention to due dates or any priority indicators to tackle the most urgent items first.
*   **Don't Let Tasks Pile Up:** Addressing tasks promptly helps keep the entire content workflow moving smoothly for your team.
*   **Understand the Context:** Before actioning a task, make sure you understand what is expected of you at that particular [workflow step](./?article=05-workflows). Refer to the main [Workflows article](./?article=05-workflows) if needed.

## Troubleshooting Common Task Issues:

*   **Task not appearing?** Ensure you are correctly assigned to the relevant [workflow step](./?article=05-workflows) for that [content type](./?article=04-templates) or [brand](./?article=02-brands). Check with your administrator (see [User Management](./?article=07-users)) if you believe you should be seeing a task but aren't.
*   **Unsure what to do?** If the task description is unclear, refer to the [workflow definition](./?article=05-workflows) or ask the person who assigned the task (or your manager) for clarification.
